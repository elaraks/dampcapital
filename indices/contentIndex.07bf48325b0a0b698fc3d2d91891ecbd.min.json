Damp is a gradual problem, one which builds up over time and accrues higher levels of visibility. I view damp as something that *makes visible* the slow violence  of long-term neglect, while *making legible the links* between this neglect and the social recomposition of urban space. \n\nFollowing this conceptualisation of the function of damp within this research, I wanted to distil an archive methodology which reflected this. So, one which foregrounded making links and connections betwen entries visible to both the user, and myself whilst using it as a working research tool.       \n\nOwing to my experiences working in a major picture archive, I arrived with a few preformed beliefs about what I felt to be important characteristics of an archive. I was keen to avoid an archiving structure that more strictly dictates an order of exploration, and did not allow the consultation of two items in conjunction. Firstly and most obviously, this ruled out the book, which can rarely truly resist the imposition of an order through its pages, and without removable items, cannot allow for two items to be looked at side by side unless they happen to be paginated. Websites in general get around some of these obstacles; for instance, being able to open multiple tabs allows the posibility of viewing items in parallel. But more traditional sequential or heirarchical site structures \n\nWith this in mind, I arrived at a web-linked, or matrix-modelled, site structure. Within this, I wanted to make visible exactly where these links were being made. While navigating a standard wiki, a user can click through pages in an associative manner, but don't gain a real insight into how these connections 'map': what is linking to what, which entries are more referenced than others. Because of this, is also harder to move to something unlinked without exiting the entry you are viewing. \n\nThe notes graph, which appears at the bottom of every page, and the side of every entry, functions as this map. \n\nThis presented some problems with tagging – entries were only connected on the graph where there was a direct link present. This meant it wasn't possible to see how entries held similarity in theme or typology. I then added the catalogue page to fill this function, with the aim of moving towards developing the the notes-graph to be searchable or filterable.
