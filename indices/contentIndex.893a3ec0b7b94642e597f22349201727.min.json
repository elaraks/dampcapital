As for other types of [atopic disease](cause-effect-affect/atopy), common triggers thrive in damp conditions, conditions which alone already have a worsening effect on respiratory health. \u003ca href=\"https://oem.bmj.com/content/70/5/325\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eResearch has shown\u003c/a\u003e that up to 15% of adult onset asthma could be attributed directly to exposure to dampness at home. \n\nAsthma is an inflammatory disease of the lungs' airways, characterised by wheezing, a tightening of the chest, and the feeling of not being able to breath well enough. Less than 100 years ago, it was thought of as a psychosomatic illness; it's treatment talking cures. Today, while its aetiology continues to elude, it is managed through a variety of medications, and lifestyle modifications. Within the latter category, the avoidance of triggers is considered to be one of the most important components of improving symptoms and preventing life-threatening attacks. But what do you do when such triggers are embedded your everyday life? When you wake up with them each morning and go to sleep with them at night?\n\n## Other respiratory problems\n\nWhile asthma is undoubtable a key focal point, other chronic respiritory problems, such as COPD and emphysema are signficantly worsened by living in damp housing. \n\n## National context\n\nThe UK has some of the worst asthma outcomes in Europe, and some of the highest of illness in the world. As noted by the [UK Centre for Moisture in Buildings](cause-effect-affect/healt-and-moisture), there is evidence this high case rate is directly linked to the moisture condition in buildings. Deaths from asthma have also increased: \u003ca href=\"https://www.asthma.org.uk/about/media/news/press-release-asthma-death-toll-in-england-and-wales-is-the-highest-this-decade/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebetween 2008 and 2018\u003c/a\u003e, they had risen by 33%.

Those in household with the lowest incomes are more signficantly more likely to have uncontrolled asthma, to have in the past year: had more than two asthma attacks, been prescribed more than two courses of oral steroids, and used emergency care. Signficantly, the same report revealed that those with asthma in London were the least likely to be recieving basic managment care. \n\nWhile income is often the focus of such measures, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/25/low-pay-and-damp-housing-driving-uk-lung-disease-deaths-study-finds\" target=\"_blank\"\u003erecent research\u003c/a\u003e has found that damp housing is a core factor driving such disparities. \n\n[^1]: Lung conditions here refers to \u003ca href=\"https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/J00-J99\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eICD-10-CM diagnositic codes J00-J99\u003c/a\u003e, which covers conditions such as COPD, asthma, pneumonia, emphysema, and bronchitis.

Coined by immunologists Arthur F. Coca and Robert Cooke in 1923, the term comes from the Greek *atopia*, meaning \"unusualness,\" \"strangeness,\" \"absurdity.\" Or \"the state of being out of place\": *A-* without, *topos* place, named such for the inappropriate and excessive nature of the response. \n\nThe causes of atopic diseases are generally poorly understood. Similarly ambiguous are the reasons behind their shaprly rising rates of incidence. However, they are increasingly shown to be highly environmentally determined. In this sense, in some ways *atopos* becomes a misnomor – these are conditions that very much do have a *place*. \n\nLike [asthma](cause-effect-affect/Asthma), rhinitis and eczema are common atopic diseases. While the relationship between damp housing and the exaccerbation of pre-known atopy is more developed, the heightened risk of developing an atopic illness in such environments is increasingly demonstrable. The exact mechanisms for this association are numerous: linked to temperature and humidity, inflammatory responses to bacteria and mould exposure, increased levels of dust mites, and so on.   \n\nThose with one atopic disease are at a higher risk for developing another. \n\n## Eczema\n\nEczema, or atopic dermatitis, is commonly thought of as dry skin, and something generally worsened by lower air humidity – such as in winter. So, it's association with damp housing might at first seem unexpected. As always, balance is key – increased moisture and humidity levels are also eczema irritants. However, more significantly, damp conditions provide the ideal conditions for the proliferation of common eczema irritants, or triggers. Living with *visible* signs of dampness, such as visible mould and damp stains, has been shown to particularly been highlighted as a risk for developing or worsening eczema.  \n\nThough often overlooked, eczema can be a debilitating and even disabling condition that greatly impacts sufferers quality of life. This can also be related to resulting [mental health problems](cause-effect-affect/mental-health), or side effects from common treatments such as long-term steroid use.   \n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://elaraks.github.io/dampcapital/278270956.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/\u003e\n\u003cp align=center\u003e\u003csub\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.leaderlive.co.uk/news/19107959.wrexham-family-flat-beset-mould/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eSource: The Leader, 2021\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/sub\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n## Rhinitis\n\nRhinitis is when a reaction occurs that causes nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, and itching. Most types of rhinitis are caused by an inflammation and are associated with symptoms in the eyes, ears, or throat. \n\nLikewise as with eczema, mould spores and dust mites are highly prevelent rhinitis triggers, largely driving the condition's association with damp housing. Repeated and prolonged exposure to these can cause the onset of the condition in those with a tendency towards atopy (through genetics, or the comorbitity of another atopic disease), particularly in children, or the development of it in those without a known history of atopy.","lastmodified":"2022-09-22T14:23:50.906173686Z","tags":null},"/cause-effect-affect/Shame":{"title":"Shame \u0026 embarrassment","content":"\nShame and embarassment are common side effects of enduring dampness. \n\nThis predominantly manifests in the experience of inviting guests over ","lastmodified":"2022-09-22T14:23:50.906173686Z","tags":null},"/cause-effect-affect/accumulative-dispossession":{"title":"Accumulative disposession","content":"\n\n\u003cobject data=\"/images/theory/Lees-White-accumulativedisposession.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"700px\" height=\"700px\"\u003e\n    \u003cembed src=\"/assets/theory/Lees-White-accumulativedisposession.pdf\"\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003eThis browser does not support PDFs.

Selected as the setting was the [Aylesbury estate](cases/aylesbury), home to 7,500 people in Southwark. \n\nThe clip below begins with a reporter saying: *\"the choice of this, the Aylesbury estate in South London, was no accident.\"* Yet if the Aylesbury's reputation had been poor before, in 1997 this was  exaccerbated and cemented through this speech. \n\n{{\u003c vimeo 752033115 \u003e}}\n\nBlair famously asserted that there must be no more \"no-hope areas\" in new Labour's Britain. With its focus on unemployment and crime, the moralising lens of the speech heralded the role that the council estate, as a broader class, would be set to play under New Labour. This role was a symbolic and ideological one, as a signifier of a spatially concentrated, dysfunctional underclass. \n\nCrutially however, Blair framed The Council Estate (as well as the Aylesbury specifically by virtue of its setting) as deteriorating, as derelict, as dilapidated in terms of its materiality. Within this, physical decay becomes inextricable from moral delay - both a cause and a symptopm of the other.

It is very minor now; a year ago it was not. White feathery mushroomed under my mattress, black spots climbed the walls. My childhood asthma resurged for the first time in a decade, I endured infection after infection. My joints hurt at night, I’ve developed allergies where before I had done.\n\nSince moving in, now two years ago, I’ve been prescribed over 20 different medications to manage these nonspecific and never-traced maladies.

These infections can be wide-ranging. Exposure to mould growth increases the risk of developing fungal infections directly from breathing in spores, particularly in those with underlying lung or immunological conditions.\n\nHowever, respiritory infections are the by far most common type of infectious illness faced by those living in damp conditions. For instance, \u003ca href=\"https://iaqscience.lbl.gov/health-risks-dampness-and-mold-houses\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emeta analysis\u003c/a\u003e has revealed a statistically significant 40-50% increase in bronchitis and other rispiratory infections in homes with dampness and mould. In 2019, \u003ca href=\"https://www.hrc.govt.nz/news-and-events/damp-homes-play-big-part-respiratory-infections\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eresearchers in New Zealand found\u003c/a\u003e that almost 20% of hospital admissions of children with respiratory infections could have been prevented if their houses were free from damp and mould. \n\nA contributing factor to this heightened risk is the weakening effect damp and mould have on your immune system. This can make people both more suseptible to catching common respiratory illnesses, and less able to 'clear' them efficiently.  \n\nThis increased risk for rispiratory illness also relates to the high rates of [asthma](cause-effect-affect/Asthma) among those living with dampness. Respiratory infections are thought to play an important etiological role in asthma, particularly in adult-onset asthma. They are also often triggers for worsening symptom management. In reverse, having a condition like asthma, particularly if it already exaccerbated by environmental triggers, makes it more likely for someone to both catch respiritory infections, and suffer with more severe illness from them.

It has been primarily linked to anxiety and depression. \n\nFor those with preexisting mental health conditions, damp housing can worsen these. Notably, in 2018 \u003ca href=\"https://www.mind.org.uk/news-campaigns/news/four-in-five-people-with-mental-health-problems-say-their-housing-has-made-their-mental-health-worse/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emental health charity Mind\u003c/a\u003e found that four in five people with mental health probems have lived in housing that 'made their mental health worse or caused a mental health problem.’ The same survey highlighted damp and mould as key problems. \n\n## Metal vs physical health\n\nThe impact dampness has on its cohabitants also highlights the inherent interelatedness of physical and mental health symptoms. In my [survey](Survey), many respondents reported anxiety relating to health problems linked to their housing that they or those they lived with were experience. This anxiety seemed particularly sharp for those living with children. \nEven for individuals without existing physical health issues, multiple respondents and interviewees reported anxiety around the *possibility* their housing was impacting the health of themselves or others. In this sense, it seems physical health is a central object  around which meantal ill-health manifests in relation to housing. This relationship is revealed as reciprocal when considering the negative impact worsening mental health can have on physical health outcomes. Indeed, I am also wary even here of deliniating such a binary between the two.  \n\n## Finances\n\nBecause experiences of damp housing, and poor housing conditions more broadly, are  inextricably tied to someone's class position, it is unsuprising that the mental health impacts of it are often related to [financial stress](cause-effect-affect/finances).\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-22T14:23:50.906173686Z","tags":null},"/cause-effect-affect/neglect":{"title":"Sink estate","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-22T14:23:50.906173686Z","tags":null},"/cause-effect-affect/nhsadvice":{"title":"NHS advice","content":"\nScreenshot from NHS page, on the health effects of damp and mould. \n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://elaraks.github.io/dampcapital/NHS-damp-and-mould.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/\u003e\n\u003cp align=center\u003e\u003csub\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/lifestyle/can-damp-and-mould-affect-my-health/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eSource: NHS, 2022\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/sub\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","lastmodified":"2022-09-22T14:23:50.906173686Z","tags":null},"/cause-effect-affect/overcrowding":{"title":"Overcrowding","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-22T14:23:50.906173686Z","tags":null},"/cause-effect-affect/penetrating-damp":{"title":"Penetrating damp","content":"\nPenetrating damp is caused by water leaking through walls, and tends to occur due to structural problems, such as faulty guttering, roofing, or cracks in walls.\n\n{{\u003c vimeo 752035016 \u003e}}\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-22T14:23:50.906173686Z","tags":null},"/cause-effect-affect/regeneration":{"title":"Regeneration","content":"\nShame and embarassment are common side effects of enduring dampness. \n\nThis predominantly manifests in the experience of inviting guests over \n\n[accumulative disposession](cause-effect-affect/accumulative-dispossession.md)","lastmodified":"2022-09-22T14:23:50.906173686Z","tags":null},"/cause-effect-affect/right-to-buy":{"title":"Right to Buy","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-09-22T14:23:50.906173686Z","tags":null},"/cause-effect-affect/sink-estate":{"title":"Sink estate","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-22T14:23:50.906173686Z","tags":null},"/cause-effect-affect/stigma":{"title":"Stigma","content":"\n\n[territorial stigmatisation](cause-effect-affect/territorial-stigmatisation)\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-22T14:23:50.906173686Z","tags":null},"/cause-effect-affect/territorial-stigmatisation":{"title":"Territorial stigmatisation","content":"\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-22T14:23:50.906173686Z","tags":null},"/cause-effect-affect/watt-aylesbury":{"title":"Territorial Stigmatisation and Poor Housing at a London ‘Sink Estate’","content":"\n\nArticle by Paul Watt examining [territorial stigmatisation](cause-affect-effect/territorial-stigmatisation) and poor housing conditons on the [Aylesbury estate](cases/aylesbury).

Damp is a gradual problem, one which builds up over time and accrues higher levels of visibility. I view damp as something that *makes visible* the slow violence  of long-term neglect, while *making legible the links* between this neglect and the social recomposition of urban space. \n\nFollowing this conceptualisation of the function of damp within this research, I wanted to distil an archive methodology which reflected this. So, one which foregrounded making links and connections betwen entries visible to both the user, and myself whilst using it as a working research tool.       \n\nOwing to my experiences working in a major picture archive, I arrived with a few preformed beliefs about what I felt to be important characteristics of an archive. I was keen to avoid an archiving structure that more strictly dictates an order of exploration, and did not allow the consultation of two items in conjunction. Firstly and most obviously, this ruled out the book, which can rarely truly resist the imposition of an order through its pages, and without removable items, cannot allow for two items to be looked at side by side unless they happen to be paginated. Websites in general get around some of these obstacles; for instance, being able to open multiple tabs allows the posibility of viewing items in parallel. But more traditional sequential or heirarchical site structures \n\nWith this in mind, I arrived at a web-linked, or matrix-modelled, site structure. Within this, I wanted to make visible exactly where these links were being made. While navigating a standard wiki, a user can click through pages in an associative manner, but don't gain a real insight into how these connections 'map': what is linking to what, which entries are more referenced than others. Because of this, is also harder to move to something unlinked without exiting the entry you are viewing. \n\nThe notes graph, which appears at the bottom of every page, and the side of every entry, functions as this map. \n\nThis presented some problems with tagging – entries were only connected on the graph where there was a direct link present. This meant it wasn't possible to see how entries held similarity in theme or typology. I then added the catalogue page to fill this function, with the aim of moving towards developing the the notes-graph to be searchable or filterable.

rough last few years, where I was living in Bow for a long time. I was married before, living with my ex in Bow, and then I had a mental health issue and we broke up and then I lived with my parents for a year in Croydon, and they still lived there. And then I lived in – so that was for about 10 months – and then I lived in Honor Oak Park, for six months. So I moved into Honor Oak Park, maybe May? May 2020, and we started looking in August, and we found this immediately. We were like, this is good and it's more affordable and it's by the river. Because it's on an ex council estate. So we were looking, we literally, I think it was the month of, you know, started looking in July and then found it, and we made an offer in August. And then we moved in, in December. So it was pretty quick and we were just like – cos my friend just mentioned it, I was like looking for studio places on my own, cause I owned a flat with my ex in Bow. And then yeah, um, when we, yeah, when he bought me out, I had a bit of money, but I couldn't find anything for like living on my own. It was impossible. And even like the smallest places. So it's like really against you, if you are single. Like the housing market, I was like, I'm not gonna be with someone just because… And then my friend just mentioned, we were just in a park and she was like, why don't we get somewhere together? And I was like, that's not a bad idea. And then we – and then there was also the, you know, the – we didn't have to pay stamp duty. Then there was a big, uh, rush. But it was, it was good because it would've been very, yeah. So that's the story. It's kind of been a bit of a… But I mean, I'm very lucky to live here. I do really like, even though there's damp issues, it's still, it's still…. Yeah. It was good for my mental health basically. I could go into it, I don't know if you want to talk about mental health, I'm quite open to talk about it, but I also realise that I overshare sometimes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Me     | No, it's completely up to you on that. It’s interesting the situation with you and your friend. Cause obviously I feel like that's becoming more of a common thing to do as well. it's just so hard, I guess like both in terms of like say buying somewhere, but also in terms of like renting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Milena | Yeah, I think I know a couple of people that do that.

Like, oh, look at this. And I, yeah. So I do remember that. But yeah, there wasn't a problem when we first moved in. So I don't know. Maybe I'm not learning how to put the heating on properly. And that could be part of the problem. And my room was very cold and yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Me     | Was it something that kind of, started emerging, starting in like January, February was there say like a leak or like a heavy spell of like rain and then it was an issue?

It was gradual. But I did suddenly notice because I painted my room in January and then I think it was like a month after then that I started noticing like, oh, this is not good. I think it was a creeping thing though. I don't know. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I can't remember if it was to do with rain, I don't think so. But I was wondering cos when we - this sounds really ditzy – but when we moved in, like we got this heating thermostat. We dunno how the hell – it's like one of those things when… Yeah, we dunno how to, so we asked the previous owners like how do we work this? Because we wanna turn down the heating or like, I don't know, control it centrally. So now we've just been like putting it right. We dunno how to type, put it on a timer or anything like that. And we need to ask – even the boiler person didn't know. So it's kind of these, one of these really annoying things. It's just really like mystifying. And so we've just been keeping it low. So cause we don't wanna keep it, because we can't put the timer on all night, I mean timers it's on certain times of the night, I'm just sleeping in the cold that during the night when I should probably have the heating on. But we just didn't – cause it's so expensive to have it on all night and we don't wanna, so we still haven't worked out properly how to do that, but I probably should. And I don't know if I ever asked actually the previous owners, if they had issues with damp, or whether they actually properly put the heating on and that's why they didn't have issues. So it's probably my fault with not working out how to decipher the heating.

So there's like a waiting list with garages. It's not necessary that the garage that you have, it's like next to your house. It's just, I think you apply for it the same way with like cycling – there's like a cycling storage thing as well. People apply for that too. It could have something where like, there's something in the garage causing it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I could tell you all about, like trying to get the council to fix – oh, did you know there's a leak? I didn't show you this, but that's not damp. That's a leak. But that's in the kitchen. There's a massive problem with the pointing or… that's why we have scaffolding. I didn't even know. My dad is explaining cause he's architect, but he was explaining to me what it was. I still didn't quite understand, but there was like an issue with the balcony upstairs or like a leak, but that's, I guess that's not damp. But it was still, like, I just, I haven't even bothered with my room because I'm just, that's like more of a priority. Cause the ceiling's literally caved in. Not like completely as a whole, but you know, it's crumbling and I just haven't even bothered with the Council, cause I'm just, it's taking us a year to, and it's still not sorted just because there's been a backlog. But they've had, this is the problem with, I mean, you probably agree, outsourcing everything. It’s like, the different contractors don’t talk to each other. We get asked the same question by different people. And it's like, this isn't efficient, like at all, to have all this outsourcing. The issue I had was like, I don't mind if there's a delay, but just tell me, just tell me. There's… the communication is horrendous, like with these kind of things. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I have no hope with the, I mean, I haven't even bothered with a damp in my room. But it's just like, when you feel like… It's like a… I dunno if it is the right book, but I haven't read it, but The Trail. Is that, is that, is that what it's about?

And it's all lost. Like, and you don't know who to talk to and you're lost in bureaucracy. There's no, like everything's very faceless. Like Ruth Gordon, the Councillor. She's pretty good at chasing, but there's only so much she can do. So I probably should read that book, but I feel like it's about that. And I just like, who do I talk to?

Yeah. It's like… I feel, I don't actually know, but I'm guessing they have less accountability if they're at arms length. I don't know. I probably should research that, but everything just seems majorly complicated. I mean, the fact that there will be reports done, and then they'll ask me the same question.

 |\n| Milena | Months and months, like maybe nine months. So it's just like, we just, just, if we just had communication to say we're poorly resourced, you can't do this right now, it will take this long. I would be fine with that. It's just the fact that it’s so faceless and there's no communication with anyone and you feel like you're screaming into a void. You're like, and again, like it's not a majorly – I had basically, it was quite stressful. We were kind of using the [mental health](cause-effect-affect/mental-health) card, which is not completely crazy. But basically I had, when I broke up with my husband, I had, this was 2019, I had psychosis and I had what was called a manic episode. Anyway, so that was the first time, but then I got it again, cause I never had any mental issues before. And then I got it again at the beginning of last year. And this was like very stressful at the time being like, I remember being – cause you are very paranoid, you’re very delusional, you're kind of suspicious of a lot of things. So dealing with these people was just like, really like what the hell. And so my care coordinator was just like, you should probably say that this is affecting your health and like, you can't help, but still it's like, I don't know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Me     | And did you feel like it was affecting your mental health?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Milena | Sorry, that probably sounds really wrong, but you just like – Maria was my care coordinator at the NHS was saying that I should mention that. And it's not, that sounds like it was like a conniving thing, but I was also like, it has, but I almost saw that as like, you should mention that as well. But I think I was just like, oh, it's just another thing. Background stress. But it's just another thing to sort out. And there were so many other things that I kind of like… But the point is that, yeah, you shouldn't have to worry about those things. But again, it's like not a major issue. Like I live in fairly comfortable accommodation. It's not… But I remember just getting lost in all these emails and just being like, what the hell is going on.

But basically, my dad's came here once and I cut his hair on the balcony and some hair drifted over the balcony next door, apparently, but we cleaned it all up. Anyway, we got a letter in the post from the council. Saying that next door were complaining about the fact that some hair had wafted over to their balcony. And like, you've literally, at lightning speed, sent this letter about a little bit of hair, which I don't think even… And it was just, you know what I mean? It was like, I can't believe this is real.

I was just like, what is going on at the council? I don't know. And I just – we even got David Lammy involved. David Lammy’s office. Like my care coordinator. It wasn't him who messaged, but like his office. And it's just like – but it shouldn't – just tell us what's happening.

Yeah. No, they did. It was a bit better. I think it helped with my care coordinator, and I think David Lamy helped. I mean having said that, it’s still – it's gone back down again, like they've done a bit of work and we were like, are you gonna take it down? Is it finished? I keep asking. Is it finished? And they’re kind of like, we’ll pass on the message. Don't you have reports that tell you what's happening? I just, or like, I don't know. And also the people downstairs, they've got scaffolding in their garden for ages. It's not even their problem, and they have to be putting up with, you know. So again, it's not the worst thing in the world, but you're like, imagine if you had a major, major issue and that people behave like that. I can't imagine what it's like with other tenants or people, you know, I dunno what it's like with council housing, if there's priority there. I don't know. I don't know what the treatment was like with the guy upstairs. He's one of the few council tenants that's left.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Me     | So are most of the other tenants, or people who live here –                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Milena | Private, yeah. Interesting story about the guy. So the people who lived here before, there were a couple with twins. The guy, he'd been here since he was six months old. And he was, he's like around 40 now. And his parents bought the flat with [Right to Buy](cause-effect-affect/right-to-buy), but he just stayed here all that time and like bought – I think him and his sister bought the flat off the parents, and then him and his wife bought the flat. So he's been here a while. But I think they liked it, but they just said that it was just the twins. It was too small for them, but I don't know. Yeah… Lorna... I shouldn't really say, but there's some characters on the estate. It's funny. It's certainly like, it's certainly interesting. And like, they, the people who've been here for quite a while… But yeah, other people have complained about damp.

If the water impacts it somehow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Milena | Yeah.

Or like the boats outside. What's wrong with the boats? And then there'll be another lady that will like argue with another one about her being really petty. And it's just funny what people worry about. I mean, generally I'm quite… But people get so – like not nosy, but they're just things that I wouldn't even think about worrying about. But this is just quite, this is different. Cause it's like ceiling falling in like, or like damp in your room. That's not – and if, especially if your clothes – it's not, it's not ideal. But again, like, there is a lot going on in my life. Like I still don't worry about it too much. It doesn't affect me too much. I don't think. But I’m sure it could get really annoying, especially if the Council is so slow to respond, it could get really difficult for people. It is just another stress. But I don't know if like… \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a friend that lives a few doors down, he's actually a Syrian refugee, but he's leaving now. The flat. But he had problems as well, with damp. But yeah, I think… But yeah. It just highlights the problems that there are with the Council. I heard there's even problems with like – actually, “even” – Kensington and Chelsea. But then obviously they were neglecting the biggest housing disaster for the last, I don't know, a hundred years. I don't know. But they're just saying it's across a lot of Councils where it's just kind of… My friend who lives in Lambeth, who I was in Brixton yesterday with, has a similar thing with her kitchen. There's like a massive damp leak. And she said the same thing. There was like all these different contractors and then didn't speak to each other and they were asking the same question. Like, that's exactly the same thing that happens to me. And she's actually in an ex council estate as well. She's a private renter.

I bought like anti mould paints. But when it kept going black, I just felt really dirty. Like, I've got this in my room. I just need like a place – with everything that's happened in the last few – I just like, I need a place where I can just feel like things are – I have a lot of clutter – but just things are at peace, where I don't have to worry about doing that. It's still not that bad, but you just… Yeah, it doesn't make you feel very nice. Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Me     | And do you work from home a lot as well?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Milena | Well, in my last job, when I was working for this consultancy, I was working from home most of the time, not coming into the office that much at all. But now I work for the Trust. I was gonna try, well… Cause I'd actually, it's a nice flat, but I don't… I try and avoid working from home if I can. Cause I don't actually enjoy it very much. I feel like I've spent enough time on my own. I mean I have my housemate, but what I mean is I don’t… Yeah, I think everyone, I don't know. I personally like being in a co-working space. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYeah, I think... I got, well, after I had my second psychosis psychotic, I've only had two as I, and then I got diagnosed with bipolar. But I had like a really high point, and then after that I got really depressed after. So in the summer, last year I was really depressed and like, anything like to do with the house, like being in the house, was just like stressful. And you'd become, like – everything was just worse because you were just… You was here all the time and you internalised everything. And then if you just went outside and you were just like, oh, there's life outside and life isn't that bad. But it's hard to know if it was because of the pandemic easing up that I got better or because of a job change or because of now that I start taking lithium, which is to kind of manage your mood. I don't, I can't believe I was that low. Like I was really sad. And I don't know if it was to do with like, being inside all the time. Working from home doesn't suit me, working from a laptop. I mean, everyone has to work from a laptop, but I mean, just getting up in the morning and going and sitting in the kitchen all here to. And it was – some people don't even have that space. You know, I have lucky that I have that space. So I was just like, this is really bad for me, you know, that's not really to do with damp. But yeah, this is just, it's just one of those things of like, it seems much worse when you're constantly in the same place all the time. And so yeah, the damp, if I was, if I'm out, like now I don't really work,  I try and go out as much as possible. I'm always going to gigs or trying to just stay out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so I don't really, I'm not too precious about… I like to keep a home nice, but I'm not like home is my life. Whereas people – we kind of got a bit of a society where everything is about the home. I know I'm a homeowner. But like, I'm not interested in necessarily making money. I was just like, if I can do it. But it's just this idea that everything is about the house. Like buying stuff for the house.

I remember like we were renting this – me and my ex – we were renting a shitty, really shitty apartment in Whitechapel. It was really… Like they didn't do any work to it at all. And they would just up the rent every year. And you're like, what's the reason for this? They'd just be like, well, the market. And it's just like, you've literally done nothing to this place and it really needs work. And I was just like, I dunno, I just… It's like a control thing, like having some… But then even, you know, it sounds like even renting from the Council, if you have social housing, they behave like that, because they're the landlord, and maybe it's the same for council housing as well. Like cause they're the freeholder here, the council's a freeholder. I dunno what it's like for people with live in social housing, which is obviously really hard to get. And also I didn't like the idea of, like we are subsidising private landlords. Like the government is giving money to landlords instead of building social housing.It's so much more expensive to do that than just building like the housing. And I just didn't like that people were just like… Like, I'm not interested in that, I just wanna live here. I want to be part of the community. I don't see it as like an asset.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike I wouldn't care if I didn't make any money off this place. I just a… It is security that.

I definitely feel insecure dealing with the council for sure. I feel like it's talking to a void. I know that councils have had major cuts and I don't know, but I don't know what's going on. It's just so… It feels like smoke mirrors. Like you don't really know – it's very… You are dealing with so many different people. So that doesn't make me feel very… But you know what? It was the same when I was – so, the flat I owned in Bow, it was like a private management company that was managing things and it was also quite bad to deal with. So it's not necessarily that the Council's any worse.

The software we had to report it. You tried calling, but you just would never get through. The reporting tool online was just so clunky and difficult to use. And then you'd send a request and you had… You don't know, you were sent to requests and you didn't know, you didn't have proper record as to what, where it was like, you had no visibility as to where it was in the queue. And, yeah, I think the thing they could have improved is communication – the status of things. And communication amongst the people that are working on the particular issue, between each other. So reports are made, but they're obviously not read by the next person who has to deal with the issue. So they use different contractors. They should be able to have access to the reporting, surely?  And also, I think there's negligence in terms of clarity in reporting. Like they would miss off information and so on. So yeah, I think communication and just clarity would be helpful, you know?

I just reached out to people in the group and Lorna, but she was an ex Councillor. I thought that she could help. And then she put me in touch with the managing director of Homes for Haringey. Ruth Gordon was good. I dunno how he got in touch with Ruth. I think  Lorna also told me about Ruth. I should have, I mean, I could have just looked up the local Councillor. Ruth was saying how embarrassing it was. She was just like, what's going on? So this clearly just me, like, it's not my imagination. Like it's clearly not good. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut then Ruth did come back and say there's been issues everywhere, with like delays and it's like a backlog of work. I dunno if it's just the pandemic who knows. It's just really… I just feel like there's so many people involved and it shouldn't, you should have like, again, like we had one point of contact, but then they change and it just seems… I dunno how they – what the governance is or like how it's managed. Like, it just seems very confusing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Me     | Is there anything else you wanna mention or bring up?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Milena    | I guess I'm just… I feel like generally people, like, I feel like it's a very like isolating experience. Or you realise how isolated people are. Generally. I feel there's not very good… Like, yeah. As someone who like, obviously being no longer in a relationship, I was just like, suddenly I wanna reach out to people. I want to like build it, or I want to be part of a community. I want to know people that I deal with or like try and create some kind of sense of like, solidarity amongst… Oh, you know, and when it feels like no one has time for anyone else or like… It's just like, you should know the people you're dealing with at a Council. They should be visible. I feel like everyone is invisible. I’m not saying like everything about community is good. Like sometimes people can be too nosy or like too involved in other people's lives. But I just feel like it's really hard to kind of develop a rapport with others or get to know people, like make people feel like they care about each other. You know what I mean? I just feel like… Cause I care about those things. I just feel like it doesn't feel there's much of a caring. I don't know if it's because it's a place where it's a very transient place to live – London in general. But then a lot of people have been here for many years. But yeah, it's just, you just feel a bit invisible and you're really trying and yeah. So I just feel like it'd be nice if there was more of a sense of feeling cared for, and also you give care.
