As for other types of [atopic disease](cause-effect-affect/atopy), common triggers thrive in damp conditions, conditions which alone already have a worsening effect on respiratory health. \u003ca href=\"https://oem.bmj.com/content/70/5/325\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eResearch has shown\u003c/a\u003e that up to 15% of adult onset asthma could be attributed directly to exposure to dampness at home.\n\nAsthma is an inflammatory disease of the lungs' airways, characterised by wheezing, a tightening of the chest, and the feeling of not being able to breath well enough. Less than 100 years ago, it was thought of as a psychosomatic illness; it's treatment talking cures. Today, while its aetiology continues to elude, it is managed through a variety of medications, and lifestyle modifications. Within the latter category, the avoidance of triggers is considered to be one of the most important components of improving symptoms and preventing life-threatening attacks. But what do you do when such triggers are embedded your everyday life? When you wake up with them each morning and go to sleep with them at night?\n\n## Other respiratory problems\n\nWhile asthma is undoubtable a key focal point, other chronic respiratory problems, such as COPD and emphysema are significantly worsened by living in damp housing.\n\n## National context\n\nThe UK has some of the worst asthma outcomes in Europe, and some of the highest of illness in the world. As noted by the [UK Centre for Moisture in Buildings](cause-effect-affect/healt-and-moisture), there is evidence this high case rate is directly linked to the moisture condition in buildings. Deaths from asthma have also increased: \u003ca href=\"https://www.asthma.org.uk/about/media/news/press-release-asthma-death-toll-in-england-and-wales-is-the-highest-this-decade/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebetween 2008 and 2018\u003c/a\u003e, they had risen by 33%.

Those in household with the lowest incomes are more significantly more likely to have uncontrolled asthma, to have in the past year: had more than two asthma attacks, been prescribed more than two courses of oral steroids, and used emergency care. Significantly, the same report revealed that those with asthma in London were the least likely to be receiving basic management care.\n\nWhile income is often the focus of such measures, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/25/low-pay-and-damp-housing-driving-uk-lung-disease-deaths-study-finds\" target=\"_blank\"\u003erecent research\u003c/a\u003e has found that damp housing is a core factor driving such disparities.\n\n[^1]: Lung conditions here refers to \u003ca href=\"https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/J00-J99\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eICD-10-CM diagnostic codes J00-J99\u003c/a\u003e, which covers conditions such as COPD, asthma, pneumonia, emphysema, and bronchitis.

Coined by immunologists Arthur F. Coca and Robert Cooke in 1923, the term comes from the Greek *atopia*, meaning \"unusualness,\" \"strangeness,\" \"absurdity.\" Or \"the state of being out of place\": *A-* without, *topos* place, named such for the inappropriate and excessive nature of the response. \n\nThe causes of atopic diseases are generally poorly understood. Similarly ambiguous are the reasons behind their shaprly rising rates of incidence. However, they are increasingly shown to be highly environmentally determined. In this sense, in some ways *atopos* becomes a misnomor – these are conditions that very much do have a *place*. \n\nLike [asthma](cause-effect-affect/Asthma), rhinitis and eczema are common atopic diseases. While the relationship between damp housing and the exaccerbation of pre-known atopy is more developed, the heightened risk of developing an atopic illness in such environments is increasingly demonstrable. The exact mechanisms for this association are numerous: linked to temperature and humidity, inflammatory responses to bacteria and mould exposure, increased levels of dust mites, and so on.   \n\nThose with one atopic disease are at a higher risk for developing another. \n\n## Eczema\n\nEczema, or atopic dermatitis, is commonly thought of as dry skin, and something generally worsened by lower air humidity – such as in winter. So, it's association with damp housing might at first seem unexpected. As always, balance is key – increased moisture and humidity levels are also eczema irritants. However, more significantly, damp conditions provide the ideal conditions for the proliferation of common eczema irritants, or triggers. Living with *visible* signs of dampness, such as visible mould and damp stains, has been shown to particularly been highlighted as a risk for developing or worsening eczema.  \n\nThough often overlooked, eczema can be a debilitating and even disabling condition that greatly impacts sufferers quality of life. This can also be related to resulting [mental health problems](cause-effect-affect/mental-health), or side effects from common treatments such as long-term steroid use.   \n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://elaraks.github.io/dampcapital/278270956.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/\u003e\n\u003cp align=center\u003e\u003csub\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.leaderlive.co.uk/news/19107959.wrexham-family-flat-beset-mould/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eSource: The Leader, 2021\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/sub\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n## Rhinitis\n\nRhinitis is when a reaction occurs that causes nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, and itching. Most types of rhinitis are caused by an inflammation and are associated with symptoms in the eyes, ears, or throat. \n\nLikewise as with eczema, mould spores and dust mites are highly prevelent rhinitis triggers, largely driving the condition's association with damp housing. Repeated and prolonged exposure to these can cause the onset of the condition in those with a tendency towards atopy (through genetics, or the comorbitity of another atopic disease), particularly in children, or the development of it in those without a known history of atopy.","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T08:07:35.923385634Z","tags":null},"/cause-effect-affect/Geoffrey-Howe":{"title":"Geoffrey Howe on Merseyside","content":"\n\u003cimg src=\"https://elaraks.github.io/dampcapital/manageddecline.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/\u003e\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T08:07:35.923385634Z","tags":null},"/cause-effect-affect/Shame":{"title":"Shame \u0026 embarrassment","content":"\nShame and embarrassment are common side effects of enduring dampness.

In addition to this, although respondents and interviewees in the [PRS](providers/PRS) did report similar *feelings*, they were less likely to report it limiting their activities. For example, while a respondent in the PRS might say it made them feel embarressed when guests were visiting, a corresponding response from a social tenant would more likely describe actively not inviting guests over at all.\n\nThis compounding of shame for social tenants is in part linked to [stigma](cause-effect-affect/stigma), which surrounds both the poor conditions in social housing, and social housing more broadly as a tenure.\n\n\u003e [!warning] How could they...\n\u003e\n\u003e Specific phrases often pop up in relation to the anxiety of someone else witnessing damp conditions.

With its focus on unemployment and crime, the moralising lens of the speech heralded the role that the council estate, as a broader class, would be set to play under New Labour. This role was a symbolic and ideological one, as a signifier of a spatially concentrated, dysfunctional underclass.\n\nCrutially however, Blair framed The Council Estate (as well as the Aylesbury specifically by virtue of its setting) as deteriorating, as derelict, as dilapidated in terms of its materiality.

A indirect financial impact might be wages lost due to sickness, either from a long term or an acute health problem likely exacerbated or caused by someone's living conditions.\n\nThe financial burden of living with dampness are often cited as a key 'worry,' highlighting the accretive [mental health](cause-effect-affect/mental-health) implications this can have.\n\nRelevant also is the growing numbers experiencing [fuel poverty](cause-effect-affect/fuel-poverty).\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T08:07:35.9273857Z","tags":null},"/cause-effect-affect/fuel-poverty":{"title":"Fuel poverty","content":"\n### What is fuel poverty?\n\nIn England, fuel poverty is measured using the Low Income Low Energy Efficiency (LILEE) indicator. Under this indicator, a household is considered to be fuel poor if:\n\u003e - they are living in a property with a fuel poverty energy efficiency rating of band D or below\n\u003e AND\n\u003e - when they spend the required amount to heat their home, they are left with a residual income below the official poverty line.\n\nThere are 3 important elements in determining whether a household is fuel poor:\n- household income\n- household energy requirements\n- fuel prices\n\n### Fuel poverty and damp housing\n\nFuel poverty has a bidirectional relationship to damp housing.\n\nThose living in fuel poverty are more exposed to the risk of enduring dampness. Without sufficient financial means to heat a dwelling to advised levels, damp and mould are more likely to thrive. Someone experiencing fuel poverty is also unlikely to be able to ventilate where they live sufficiently enough to mitigate and improve damp conditions in winter. For someone using central heating, this would see the money they spend on this escaping out of the open window; for those not using central heating, opening windows would decrease the indoor [temperature](evidence/temperature) even further, with both unpleasant and dangerous effects.\n\nOn the flip side, those living in damp housing are more likely to be pushed into fuel poverty in attempts to manage and mitigate the extent of the condition. This is especially true when considering the disproportionate levels of dampness among the poorest.   \n\nGiven the rising costs of energy in the UK, levels of fuel poverty are expected to rise dramatically over the winter; undoubtably this will also lead to a directly correlated rise of those enduring dampness.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T08:07:35.9273857Z","tags":null},"/cause-effect-affect/gentrification":{"title":"Gentrification","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T08:07:35.9273857Z","tags":null},"/cause-effect-affect/health":{"title":"(ill)Health","content":"\n## Overview\n\nIll-health is commonly reported by those living with damp conditions. \n\nWhile this can often referr to specific conditions such as [asthma](cause-effect-affect/Asthma), [atopic](cause-effect-affect/Atopy), [mental health problems](cause-effect-affect/mental-health), and more, the ebbs and flows in how our body carries traces are far from definitive. \n\nAlso endured is a more generalised, non-specific poor quality of health. \nGetting ill more than usual from repeat [infections](cause-effect-affect/infection), random flare ups of rashes, coughs, and pains.

It is very minor now; a year ago it was not. White feathery mushroomed under my mattress, black spots climbed the walls. My childhood asthma resurged for the first time in a decade, I endured infection after infection. My joints hurt at night, I’ve developed allergies where before I had done.\n\nSince moving in, now two years ago, I’ve been prescribed over 20 different medications to manage these nonspecific and never-traced maladies. Antibiotics, antivirals, steroids, painkillers, bronchodilators, antihistamines, immunomodulators. I have inhaled metered aerosol, swallowed pills with food and on empty stomachs, rubbed creams into my skin like ritual. My friends remark that I am often ill: before this date, my last  prescription had been in 2014. \n\nSo when I speak to someone, and they tell me of their anaphylaxis, of their lying awake at night wondering and worrying, of their trouble walking up the stairs: I always need to catch my breath.  \n","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T08:07:35.9273857Z","tags":null},"/cause-effect-affect/health-and-moisture":{"title":"Health and Moisture in Buildings","content":"\nReport on the relationship between health and moisture in buildings, released by the UK Centre for Moisture in Buildings. \n\n\u003ca href=\"https://elaraks.github.io/dampcapital/images/health/health-and-moisture.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRight click and select 'Open link in new tab' to view as PDF\u003c/a\u003e. \n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://elaraks.github.io/dampcapital/health-and-moisture-01.jpg\" width=\"50%\"/\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://elaraks.github.io/dampcapital/health-and-moisture-03.jpg\" width=\"50%\"/\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://elaraks.github.io/dampcapital/health-and-moisture-04.jpg\" width=\"50%\"/\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://elaraks.github.io/dampcapital/health-and-moisture-05.jpg\" width=\"50%\"/\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://elaraks.github.io/dampcapital/health-and-moisture-06.jpg\" width=\"50%\"/\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://elaraks.github.io/dampcapital/health-and-moisture-07.jpg\" width=\"50%\"/\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://elaraks.github.io/dampcapital/health-and-moisture-08.jpg\" width=\"50%\"/\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://elaraks.github.io/dampcapital/health-and-moisture-09.jpg\" width=\"50%\"/\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://elaraks.github.io/dampcapital/health-and-moisture-10.jpg\" width=\"50%\"/\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://elaraks.github.io/dampcapital/health-and-moisture-11.jpg\" width=\"50%\"/\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://elaraks.github.io/dampcapital/health-and-moisture-12.jpg\" width=\"50%\"/\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://elaraks.github.io/dampcapital/health-and-moisture-13.jpg\" width=\"50%\"/\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://elaraks.github.io/dampcapital/health-and-moisture-14.jpg\" width=\"50%\"/\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://elaraks.github.io/dampcapital/health-and-moisture-15.jpg\" width=\"50%\"/\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://elaraks.github.io/dampcapital/health-and-moisture-16.jpg\" width=\"50%\"/\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://elaraks.github.io/dampcapital/health-and-moisture-17.jpg\" width=\"50%\"/\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://elaraks.github.io/dampcapital/health-and-moisture-18.jpg\" width=\"50%\"/\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://elaraks.github.io/dampcapital/health-and-moisture-19.jpg\" width=\"50%\"/\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://elaraks.github.io/dampcapital/health-and-moisture-20.jpg\" width=\"50%\"/\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://elaraks.github.io/dampcapital/health-and-moisture-21.jpg\" width=\"50%\"/\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://elaraks.github.io/dampcapital/health-and-moisture-22.jpg\" width=\"50%\"/\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://elaraks.github.io/dampcapital/health-and-moisture-24.jpg\" width=\"50%\"/\u003e\n\u003cp align=center\u003e\u003csub\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ukcmb.org/2019/10/27/health-and-moisture-in-buildings-report/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eSource: UKCMB, 2019\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/sub\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T08:07:35.9273857Z","tags":null},"/cause-effect-affect/huq-harwood-unhoming":{"title":"Making Homes Unhomely","content":"\nArticle by Efadul Huq and Stacy Anne Harwood examining the politics of [displacement](cause-effect-affect/displacement) in Chicago.

These infections can be wide-ranging. Exposure to mould growth increases the risk of developing fungal infections directly from breathing in spores, particularly in those with underlying lung or immunological conditions.\n\nHowever, respiritory infections are the by far most common type of infectious illness faced by those living in damp conditions. For instance, \u003ca href=\"https://iaqscience.lbl.gov/health-risks-dampness-and-mold-houses\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emeta analysis\u003c/a\u003e has revealed a statistically significant 40-50% increase in bronchitis and other rispiratory infections in homes with dampness and mould. In 2019, \u003ca href=\"https://www.hrc.govt.nz/news-and-events/damp-homes-play-big-part-respiratory-infections\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eresearchers in New Zealand found\u003c/a\u003e that almost 20% of hospital admissions of children with respiratory infections could have been prevented if their houses were free from damp and mould. \n\nA contributing factor to this heightened risk is the weakening effect damp and mould have on your immune system. This can make people both more suseptible to catching common respiratory illnesses, and less able to 'clear' them efficiently.  \n\nThis increased risk for rispiratory illness also relates to the high rates of [asthma](cause-effect-affect/Asthma) among those living with dampness. Respiratory infections are thought to play an important etiological role in asthma, particularly in adult-onset asthma. They are also often triggers for worsening symptom management. In reverse, having a condition like asthma, particularly if it already exaccerbated by environmental triggers, makes it more likely for someone to both catch respiritory infections, and suffer with more severe illness from them.

Since this moment, the phrase has taken on new urgency and understanding in relation to the urban environment.\n\nFrequently, housing campaigners frame the conditions of the estates they live on as the result of 'managed decline.'

It has been primarily linked to anxiety and depression. \n\nFor those with preexisting mental health conditions, damp housing can worsen these. Notably, in 2018 \u003ca href=\"https://www.mind.org.uk/news-campaigns/news/four-in-five-people-with-mental-health-problems-say-their-housing-has-made-their-mental-health-worse/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emental health charity Mind\u003c/a\u003e found that four in five people with mental health probems have lived in housing that 'made their mental health worse or caused a mental health problem.’ The same survey highlighted damp and mould as key problems. \n\n## Metal vs physical health\n\nThe impact dampness has on its cohabitants also highlights the inherent interelatedness of physical and mental health symptoms. In my [survey](Survey), many respondents reported anxiety relating to health problems linked to their housing that they or those they lived with were experience. This anxiety seemed particularly sharp for those living with children. \nEven for individuals without existing physical health issues, multiple respondents and interviewees reported anxiety around the *possibility* their housing was impacting the health of themselves or others. In this sense, it seems physical health is a central object  around which meantal ill-health manifests in relation to housing. This relationship is revealed as reciprocal when considering the negative impact worsening mental health can have on physical health outcomes. Indeed, I am also wary even here of deliniating such a binary between the two.  \n\n## Finances\n\nBecause experiences of damp housing, and poor housing conditions more broadly, are  inextricably tied to someone's class position, it is unsuprising that the mental health impacts of it are often related to [financial stress](cause-effect-affect/finances).\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T08:07:35.9273857Z","tags":null},"/cause-effect-affect/neglect":{"title":"Neglect","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T08:07:35.9273857Z","tags":null},"/cause-effect-affect/nhsadvice":{"title":"NHS advice","content":"\nScreenshot from NHS page, on the health effects of damp and mould. \n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://elaraks.github.io/dampcapital/NHS-damp-and-mould.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/\u003e\n\u003cp align=center\u003e\u003csub\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/lifestyle/can-damp-and-mould-affect-my-health/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eSource: NHS, 2022\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/sub\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T08:07:35.9273857Z","tags":null},"/cause-effect-affect/overcrowding":{"title":"Overcrowding","content":"\nOvercrowded housing is significantly more susceptible to [condensation](cause-effect-affect/condensation).

In the social sector, a housing shortage that disproportionately effects larger properties means that often, as families increase in sizes, there simply isn't the stock available to accommodate this, leading to many living in overcrowded dwellings for extended periods of time. This shortage of larger properties has in part been driven by the fact such properties are more likely to have been bought as part of [Right to Buy](cause-effect-affect/right-to-buy).\n\nAs condensation in particular is often framed by Councils and housing providers as the fault of tenants, and something that they should mitigate with lifestyle changes (for instance, showering less), the impact overcrowding has reveals how often this is not only out of the control of tenants, but also that fault lies instead local and national governments.

In this short clip, repeatedly broadcast between programming, we see a manufactured image of the estate as run down, replete with graffiti ‘absent in real life,’ staged with ‘rubbish across the whole of the area.’ Although coverage of damp conditions is not staged in this same way, it still engages in this same ecosystem of discourses. \n\nFurther to this, the growing mass of visual and textual material on poor conditions can be said to impact increasing levels of [stigmatisation](cause-effect-affect/stigma) for tenants.

Damp is a gradual problem, one which builds up over time and accrues higher levels of visibility. I view damp as something that *makes visible* the slow violence  of long-term neglect, while *making legible the links* between this neglect and the social recomposition of urban space.\n\nFollowing this conceptualisation of the function of damp within this research, I wanted to distil an archive methodology which reflected this. So, one which foregrounded making links and connections between entries visible to both the user, and myself whilst using it as a working research tool.       \n\nOwing to my experiences working in a major picture archive, I arrived with a few preformed beliefs about what I felt to be important characteristics of an archive. I was keen to avoid an archiving structure that more strictly dictates an order of exploration, and did not allow the consultation of two items in conjunction. Firstly and most obviously, this ruled out the book, which can rarely truly resist the imposition of an order through its pages, and without removable items, cannot allow for two items to be looked at side by side unless they happen to be paginated. Websites in general get around some of these obstacles; for instance, being able to open multiple tabs allows the possibility of viewing items in parallel. But more traditional sequential or hierarchical site structures also delineate order in a more didactic way.\n\nWith this in mind, I arrived at a web-linked, or matrix-modelled, site structure. Within this, I wanted to make visible exactly where these links were being made. While navigating a standard wiki, a user can click through pages in an associative manner, but don't gain a real insight into how these connections 'map': what is linking to what, which entries are more referenced than others. Because of this, is also harder to move to something unlinked without exiting the entry you are viewing.\n\nThis presented some problems with tagging – entries were only connected on the graph where there was a direct link present. This meant it wasn't possible to see how entries held similarity in theme or typology. I then added the catalogue page to fill this function, with the aim of moving towards developing the the notes-graph to be searchable or filterable.\n\nThe notes graph, which appears at the bottom of the home page, and the side of every entry, functions as this map. The graph displayed at the bottom of the home page is a 'global' map – it displays all entries and links.

With the aim of collectively politicising renters as a class position, they tend to perform activities within two broad categories: responsive activities (such as organising direct actions in response to evictions), and long-term activities (such as campaigning and lobbying work).  \n\nWithin London, renters unions have tended to focus on private renters, or at least tended to be thought of as having a focus on private renters. Part of this is due to the comparative under organisation of private renters, with many social housing estates being represented and organised by active Tenant and Resident Associations. Increasingly this divide is becoming less prevalent. This shift can be traced to campaigning and organising being done on poor conditions, which either mobilises across tenure, or frequently focuses on specific estates and properties owned by specific providers.\n\n### London Renters unions\n\nLondon Renters Union (LRU) is a renters union covering London, the city with the highest rents in Europe. It operates on three principles: community (regular meetings, socials, trainings and other events), solidarity (direct support for members facing housing issue), and campaigning (taking action and building power to transform the housing system more broadly).\n\nWhile the union is active in many areas of London, there are a limited number of formalised branches: in Newham \u0026 Leytonstone, Hackney, Haringey, and Lewisham. This is because nascent branches have to need to be satisfied their membership meets a level of representation of the local community before it can be designated as an official branch. This mechanism exists to limit the existence of branches dominated by white, middle class 'activists.'\n\nLRU grew out of a smaller, localised renters union in [Hackney](providers/hackney) called Hackney DIGS.\n\n### Acorn\n\nAcorn has a slightly more expansive remit than LRU or other more strictly defined as renters unions, describing itself as a 'community union.' However, in reality, much of Acorn's organising concerns renters issues, and the group is commonly thought of as a renters union.\n\nUntil recently, LRU and Acorn had a mutual understanding that while Acorn might set up branches in London, it would not do so in areas where LRU already had an active branch in place, and visa-versa. The idea behind this was to both limit confusion, and centralise rentier power within one, more effective branch, rather than splitting it between two. More recently, we have seen a break from this: most notably in Acorn establishing a Haringey branch while a LRU one was already in existence.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T08:07:36.311392091Z","tags":null},"/resistance/resistance":{"title":"Resistance","content":"\nDamp conditions are resisted on a daily basis.

|\n| Dave | Yeah, so couple of disclaimers. I am the chairperson for Straw Bale UK, which is the first straw bale builders association in the United Kingdom. We set up around 2015. I volunteered for that group, I was one of the founder members. And I joined that group, which is quite pertinent to this conversation, because the property that I lived in is an 11 story tower block, which is about to be destroyed because it's part of the [regeneration](cause-effect-affect/regeneration). It's not fit for purpose.  But when I was living with my family at the time we had quite severe bouts of damp and condensation. And I did a carpentry and joinery course around 2012, and on the course, I went to visit an exhibition called Eco Build, and at Eco Build I met this lady who I'd seen on television weeks beforehand called Barbara Jones. The television programme was called Grand Designs – you’ve probably heard of it. And she was demonstrating how to build with straw – she built a straw bale house in Grand Designs and there she was right in front of me in 3D at this exhibition, demonstrating how to work with straw and the beauty or the benefits of building with low carbon materials, for straw is a low carbon material, is the way vapour disperses itself through the material. So it also has wonderful thermal benefits as well. So in the warm climates that we're having time to go at the moment, right, in London, you would be cooler living in a natural house, natural in their low carbon natural material. And in the winter you'd be warmer.

One of my flatmates is doing architecture qualification Masters, and he did a big project on, kind of similar to this, using hemp as a building material. Okay. Um, and like hemp. Yeah. For similar reasons. Like low-carbon, natural building material.

Exactly the same. So I personally advocate working with low carbon materials. So the reason, or the purpose, of me giving you that disclaimer is because at the time when I was living in that property – I say, living in it, I've now moved a new build right on the estate, literally two weeks ago, and we'll probably go into that in a second – but at the time when I was living in that property, I was a fitness trainer, an elite fitness trainer for Virgin Active. But many years of fitness training and sports, my speciality was sports – I was a 200 metre sprinter, trained with some of the best international athletes in the world. And I also, when I finished that, I went into music, as a buyer for one of the top independent jazz and funk specialists in the country. But I threw all of that to one side because everything that was happening in my life, in my home, my neighbour's homes was becoming very destructive, you know, it affects me quite a bit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI could see people who were coming up to me because we resurrected the residence association, which is how you've come to connect with me. And we realised when people were coming to us that a lot of works that were promised by the housing association weren't being delivered. So families living in [overcrowded](cause-effect-affect/overcrowding) homes were finding that despite the fact that they were informing the housing association what was happening, they just weren't being carried out, you know, for one reason or another. And it tended to be for a negative reason, not for a positive one. As I'm sure you probably would've found out in your ventures, in your works. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYeah, so there you go. That's my disclaimer, and I now work for –so as I said, you know, music and sports gone out the window now  my own physical state of health is forget about that. I couldn't run for the bus if you asked me to, and these days I’m still involved in DJing, you know, from here, there and everywhere. But now I'm very much involved in the sustainable building industry or sector. So I now work as communications and events manager for the Sustainable Traditional Building Alliance. And we specialise in traditional heritage buildings. So pre 1919. So there you go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Me   | That's really interesting. And now I wanna ask you just like more stuff about your life. Thank you for that. What I've been doing, I've been starting these interviews with most people I've interviewed is starting with just asking you more general questions about where you were living. Like, if you could tell me more information about who you were living with, what was the size of the property, where was it? That sort of thing. Some of that would probably be stuff you've already covered, but that sort of information is kind of like a useful frame. So you were living there until two weeks ago, did you say?

                                               |\n| Dave | The present? Yeah. Yeah. So that tower block I was referring to literally, it's right next door to where I am at the moment. So to give you a bit of context, if you like, if that helps, I dunno if that will help or not. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe housing association – the housing association everybody has heard about by now – bought or acquired the stock – most of the social housing stock – from Merton Council. Yes. Um, I think that was around 2008, 2009, I can't remember approximately. I can give you a timeline if I can send you off that stuff. But right now I can't remember precisely. And this was this mainly because the Council, like many other councils in the country just couldn't keep up with the amount of the work that needed to be carried out. And the housing association, at the time they were called Circle, they've changed their names quite a few times over the years, or maybe they were called Merton Priory. Anyway, it doesn't really matter. The facts of the matter is, they acquired the stock and they did it on the promise to the residents that they would refurbish their homes. Yeah? So people who were living in, you know, homes that were full of damp and condensation, they were going to go in and patch them up, do what needs to be done. And they carried out a consultation and some of the residents in the first round, if my memory serves me well, didn't wanna do it. I think they were a bit dubious. And then they had another round of voting and we agreed. I myself personally agreed because, you know, I could see what was going on, where I thought, right, okay, this could win, we could win, we'd benefit from this. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then I would say the first year or two things were okay. And then what happened after the next few years, so 2010, 2011, we just didn't move anywhere from where we were. So if you like, the initial start was full of roses and chocolates and champagne, and thereafter, you know, people just found that calls to their call centre weren't being sufficiently logged or suitably logged. Yes. So they had a problem with their, with their call centre effectively. You know, calls were made out by residents, nobody would come, you'd then call again, to inform them about your leak, for example. And there'd be no record of your call. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen what happened, is this escalated to the point that people were getting really, really fed up with it. And in this particular area – so I live in the Abbey Ward with Merton Abbey, part of Merton Council. And it’s right in the heart of Merton – 15 minutes away is Wimbledon, where all the Wimbledon tennis and all of that kind of stuff takes place. So we are classed as, we're called south Merton. And, uh, it's a very different kettle of fish to where Wimbledon tennis takes place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd what happened thereafter, is that we found out the Councillors in this ward, the three of them, so Abby Jones, Katie Levine, Andrew Judge, collectively decided to inspect what was going on with the Council, with the housing association. And this was also because at the time there was a – a whistleblower came forward from the housing association and they outlined that, you know, things just weren't happening properly. So both of those two things came together and, thereafter that we found – to say it was fraudulent, you know, I'm probably incriminating myself or litigating myself. I don't, I can't really say that that was the case, but there were financial discrepancies from the housing association with the contractors that they were using. So procurement process was most definitely at fault. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen they decided... Right. Okay. Whilst this is all ongoing… So you can imagine, you know, as a resident, okay, I might be very much involved in it, but as a resident, if you’re living on this estate, you’re kind of confused as to what’s happening, as to the state of play. And they then decided, okay, this has gone too far now, we need to have a regeneration. They felt, the housing association felt there's too much wrong on the estate to rectify just by simply refurbishing the properties. Let's just mow it all down and start again. I, for one agreed with that. Yeah. But there was a caveat, which is that number one residents needed to be involved. And number two, I preferred for, as I've stipulated at the beginning, low carbon materials to be involved in that. You know, I met with the director of regeneration several times and his team and the architects and, you know, really stipulated let's do what we can.  Even went to planning meetings at the Council to put forward our views, but they weren't really taken on board.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo then we had another series of consultations, which was even more, you know… So basically there was survey fatigue which was happening in this area. You know, you've been surveyed continually and even confusingly because at one point two very important surveys were delivered at the same time by the housing association and by the council to ask people if we wanted the area to be regenerated. One was asking one thing, one was asking the other. But if you looked between, if you looked at both of them, they were more or less saying the same thing. But people found it very confusing. We had, I think it was 54% of the residents on this estate agreed. There was 624 homes on the estate – 654, I beg your pardon – and 54% agreed to having a regeneration. So the housing association association went about, you know, getting to works with that, having workshops with the residents. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd we are now in the, just about to start phase two. So I'm living in phase one right now. I moved in about two weeks ago. I was the last social tenant to move from my property. We have six other phases to go through. And that’s it. Some of which some of the phases will be only available to the – for buying. So, you can't, if you're social tenant, for example, move into one of those. But if there is one bonus from all of this it's that all of the residents on the estate are not being decanted. So we're not being lifted out here, moved to Birmingham or any, or Croydon, or wherever, anywhere else, whilst this is all going, we are living here on the estate. I mean it has its pluses and negatives. You know, the negatives are that you're just surrounded by. Literally by noise. If we'd had this meeting maybe seven or eight months ago, I mean, you'd have to close the windows to try and be heard cause it would just be really incredibly noisy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I moved from there as I said, two weeks ago. And previous to that, when I was living there with my family at the time, that is my wife, well ex-wife, and our four children in a two bedroom property. And the stipulation I have, and the reason why I very much am quite evangelical about low carbon materials is that in the property of that time – if that property was made of low material, so hemp, straw, lyme, clay, things like that, we wouldn't have had the kinda condensation that we had. 100%. And that's it. That's it essentially, that's where we are. |\n| Me   | Thank you. That is loads of information. So I have a few questions, and some of them are more just clarifications and some maybe will go a bit further. One was just, you said just now that, you were the last social tenant to move into the new builds during this phase one. When you say last social tenant, are there other people, so like leaseholders, still on the estate?

|\n| Dave | No, they have the option to do that. If they want to. Some people haven't, some people on the estate… So just to be clear, once the housing association acquired the right to regenerate the estate, everybody was then informed of the residents' offer. So the social tenants were given one document and lease holders were given another, well, it was all bound in the same document, but you had two different offers if you like. And for some leaseholders, they just didn't feel it was fair. The deal that they were offered. They sold up and left, um, and others have opted to stay.

It's really, really, I mean, that's quite a content question, if I'm honest with you. I'm in favour of it, but not on the way it's being delivered is the honest answer. You know, and the reason why I'm in favour of it is because it allows our families who are living in overcrowded properties to move into new properties that are suitable for their needs. So I know that on this estate, that are lots of families who are living in overcrowded properties and, given what I said to you earlier about my own context, you know, I know what that’s like, and I wouldn't want for them to stay in the positions that they're right now. Because the only options that, you know, the only options that are open to them is that, if the government, for example, or maybe even if the housing association, were to put in a massive amount of funding into it, then you could possibly retrofit the properties. I dunno if you know much about retrofitting at all, retrofitting the properties suitably, you know. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou know, one of the mistakes we made – and I'm just gonna put this into context for when I say retrofit, cause it's quite – the words you use are very… What I've come to realise the words you use in all of this, all of this are so very important. Your requests, your demands to either the housing association, the Council, or the Member of Parliament. They take your words literally. Right? And if you aren't very clear and transparent about what it is that you need and what you want, then your demands can be twisted. So for example, one of the words that we were using quite frequently when the option to regenerate these estate, back in the day, was yes, we wanted to regenerate, we want you to refurbish as part of the regeneration.  Refurbishment is really quite tokenistic gesture. It doesn't do much in the way of sorting out the fabric of a building. Retrofitting, however, is a very different kettle of fish. Retrofitting effectively, what it means is replacing either the inner wall insulation or the external wall insulation. Or if you're living in a terraced house, as some people on this estate do, installing the right type of roof installation. So we went about it – and this is for our own, our own naivety as residents – we went about it asking the wrong kind thing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other thing was ensuring that your footprint is the same in the in the regeneration.So there are – in fact, it goes the same for all of us, but I think it's more so for the leaseholders and freeholders where this refers to – is that the size of their property, because they are owners, right, they would like for that size to be the same when they go to a new build. So what we used to say is ‘like for like,’ we want – if you're going to regenerate the sustain, we're going to ask for ‘like for like.’ And we kept saying it. We kept saying it, that phrase ‘like for like.’ And that didn't do as much in the way favours, because, um, the way the housing association got around that was by saying that we are going to deliver, and this is really important, we are going the new homes that are bigger than the London Plan. And the London plan is what Sadiq is offering for regeneration. Astonishingly or unsurprisingly, the London Plan buildings or requirements, the measurements are smaller than what we have presently. So, you know, people have sat there nodding their heads, like, you know, those dogs at the back of a car going, oh, London Plan, they're gonna go bigger than that, right? But then when you look at the London plan, measure measurements, you go, hang on a minute. That's not the same. So what they're doing on this estate is practically quadrupling the size. We're gonna have 2,800 homes, at the end of it all. By the end of 2038, we'll have 2800 homes. And if you're gonna that, if you're gonna, you can imagine the homes gonna be smaller.

tenure. So there are, so there are 1, 2, 3, 4 phases, which would be for private tenures. And that would be for Clarion’s disposal as to how they deal with that. So they'll either sell it to the outside market or I think they might rent it at market value, market price, because that’s what everybody is making money out of, if you’re a landlord.

That is really helpful. And I'm sorry that the question ended up being quite contentious. There was another question I had about something you said. So you're talking about when Circle acquired these properties from Merton Council, and then it becomes Clarion at some point. Do you remember when that was? Cause I was wondering as well, you talked about how the first two years seemed great. Was there any change that coincided with it being subsumed into Clarion? Or was that more a rebrand rather than a merger?

In 2010, right, in 2010 they were called Merton Priory. They then put forward their pitch to the Council, and the Council then delivered that – or Merton Priory then delivered that pitch to us as residents. And in 2014 Circle signed up to – because their repairs and maintenance were so bad – they've signed up to this promise called the 10 commitments, which basically amounted to them saying, we're gonna promise to do this, we’re gonna promise to do that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI mean, they haven't really done it, but that's where they were. Around 2015 there was a legal action. That's what I referred to much earlier. And in 2015, April, the overall management company called Circle Anglia were downgraded to G3 for chronic problems to its emergency repairs. Which left some vulnerable tenants with exceptionally poor service. I'm gonna send you some links and stuff, so you'd be able to understand it then. I would say around 2015, 2016 is when they merged with another housing association called Affinity Suffolk and became Clarion. The idea behind that, you know, if we're gonna be cynical about it is fundamentally to join both amounts of housing stock, which would enable them to go to banks and lenders to get more money to do this, that and the other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat's what it amounted to. Because if you want my honest frank opinion, and the information is there, I attended, um, a scrutiny panel meeting at Merton Council whereby Affinity Suffolk were invited to put forward their position about this merger. And at the time – I was sat in the gallery – I was allowed to put forward a question as the chairperson for the Resident’s Association. And I asked, why are Affinity Suffolk merging with Circle when Affinity Suffolk’s performances on repairs and maintenance is worse? Yeah. They were very open to admitting that their repairs and maintenance service was worse, which really, if I'm honest and frank with you just displayed the really brazen act of just joining together purely because it was an option for them, an easy option for them, to go to banks and lenders and say, look, instead of having 200 homes, we've now got 400 because we've merged with another housing association. And that is what a lot of housing associations at the time were doing. It wasn't just Cirlce or doing that just to be clear. And the other thing, a disclaimer if you like, is I was actually on Circle’s board as a resident representative. I got kicked off. Not just because I was a troublemaker but because I was in rent arrears, and one of the stipulations, was if that you were in rent arrears, you can't be on their board. So I was privy to a lot of information. You know, the stuff that I know is very much open.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Me   | I feel like I was semi-familiar with – I think particularly, cause obviously there's been a lot of stuff about Eastfields Estate, which were acquired in the same large scale voluntary transfer. And also by Clarion from Merton. But it's sometimes really hard to kind of follow that information, of what company is what, especially cause they will have these like kind of abstractly sounding names that could be anywhere or anything.

Yeah. And you know what, if you were – and I hate to use this expression – but if you were just a humble resident, right, you’d  be really confused as to who it was that you were paying your rent to. You know, they've changed their names four times. So they've gone from Circle to Merton Priory, to um, Circle Affinity was the overriding group, and then went to, um… What did I say? Circle, Merchant Priory… I'm even confused now as to what it is, as to what it was at the time. But yeah, they changed their name. They changed their name and their brand three times and astonishingly, or not as the case may be, some residents, and I'm talking about the elderly ones and the vulnerable ones particularly, still feel or felt that they were paying their rent to Merton Council, not to the housing association. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo in a lot of instances, the ones ought to be made accountable, so the housing association, weren’t. Because depending on the time of the year or whenever there was a local election of general election, you know, the Councillors would pick up on cases, right, if we could call it that, for residents and because a resident is dealing with that Councillor directly, they would be under the impression that the Council were dealing with it as opposed to the housing association. So there was so much confusion. So much confusion for people.

Very much so. I dunno if you are aware the expression to the expression TUPE? It's transfer – or I dunno what it, I can’t remember what it stands for, you'd have to look it up. But basically it's essentially, it's a transfer of public sector groups to another, right. And so what happened when Merton transferred their stock to Circle, it acquired the people who are working for Merton Council housing. So in essence the same, I wanna swear, but the same idiots who were working at Merton Council went over to Circle, and we were still dealing with the same non-entities who were working before. The same people who are incompetent were delivering on, on that. Do you understand what I'm saying?  And they then went through their procurement process to get in their contractors, the contractors who were an incapable bunch of idiots, they themselves, when they were found guilty, if you like, and culpable and accountable for the mistakes they were delivering on repairs and maintenance – the company would fold, but then those people would be transferred over to another company. And still be employed by Circle and it's still going on to this day. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd the stuff that I sent to you by email, you'll see a name, an organisation called KeepMoat, and KeepMoat are a very popular organisation who deliver repairs and maintenance on behalf of housing associations and councils. And despite the fact that they messed up here, they then fold, and you know, the general public will be thinking, oh, there's a new organisation in town, they are gonna… and then you see these people turning up on your doorstep, and be like hang on a minute, you’re just wearing a different sweatshirt. You’re the same bloke who was here before. So for residents in the main, what you found it was the same level of incompetence that's happened before. And I know this because I also sat, as well as their Board, there was a group repairs and maintenance group for Circle, which allowed residents points of contact. We had monthly meetings or quarterly meetings to hold them to account on their KPIs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I was chairing that, you know, it was just comical, the kind of things that you could see from these contractors that were happening, you know. They were going to people's homes either late or on time and not having a clue as to what the work it was that they had to do. So they would have the job description on their computer readout, and it wouldn't be a full description, you know, it'd be missing crucial element. Like for example, I dunno, there’s a leak coming from the roof of a family's home, that person lives on the top floor of a three story complex. And the builder or the contractor would go there and not be told that the guttering isn't in place or the guttering needs working on too. So they'd be going there thinking that I'm just gonna to replaster something, not aware of the fact that there are other outstanding issues related to that too. So it was that kinda thing just made us think, well, okay, you guys still dunno what you're doing and it's still going on to this day. These kind things still, you know, I've had two messages over the past two days from residents who have told me this stuff going on in their block, which they're still outstanding. And despite the fact that they've been, you know, relaying this onto the housing association it's not been dealt with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Me   | And so you mentioned before you used to be a sports trainer, and then you worked in music, I think you kind of alluded that with everything that was happening around you kind of gave that up.

Yeah, it was,you know, the stuff I was going through and people were telling me they were going through the same thing – at that point I was divorced. So you know, single living on my own, and I could have just gone travelling around the world if I wanted to. Or just working nine to five and coming home, watching EastEnders, Coronation Street, and not giving a toss, if I'm frank, about any other person's issue. But it is heartbreaking and it ruins families. You can see that this kind of stuff, the stresses it causes people, families I know, who are, who are going through this kinda stuff. It's horrible. If you are family, if you are four person family – so mother and father and two kids – and you're living in a one bedroom property and that one bedroom property has got a leak coming through, which is not being sorted out. Can you imagine your kind of stress that's causing you as a couple and what it does to your children? You know, if you've got young teenagers, they're embarrassed to bring their friends around to their house. Because they've got nowhere to hang out, they've got nowhere to play, you know, and the families are [embarrassed to invite their friends or families](cause-effect-affect/Shame). And I know this for a fact, because people tell me this, they say, look, this home is horrible. We can't invite people round. So it means you become isolated and you become insular. You know, your problems become far more dynamic than they were initially. And life is just one pain in the neck after another. And it's predominantly because of the… I would use the word deception that the housing association and the council cause they colluded in this, right? I'm not gonna blame just the housing association, the Council are very much to blame without this too, and also the Government. So those three parties were colluded in this, you know. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur local MP is a Conservative Member of Parliament, and he has been in place ever since the stock transfer happened. And he hasn't really – in fact I know – he hasn't really dealt with it in the matter that we would like, because he knows it's so complicated. They've become an organisation that is too big to fail. And is not a Minister of a department, so he doesn't sit in any specific department per se, so he doesn't have significant amount of power to deal with these things. So in terms of being an advocate, yeah, he will put for the motion in the House of Commons, but it does next to nothing. It does next to nothing in terms of dealing with the overall problems that we have. And the Government, if we're gonna get politics now, the Government wanna wipe their hands with it, because they feel it will cost, um, too much money for them to deal with. So they'd rather give it to the housing association who can profit from it, deal with it, and then put the blame on them when things don't go right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Me   | Yeah, no for sure. Nearly very single person I've interviewed or like talked to has said exactly the same thing about inviting people over, or just like not wanting to be in the house yourself. It is probably the most consistent thing that anyone I've spoken to said, if you see what I mean. So, how long would you say your flat had a problem with damp, or with maintenance issues?

Okay. In 1999. And I got married 2000, and then we we had children there. I would say probably it didn't take more than a year for those problems, few months, actually, for those problems to escalate, you know? Because I was living there initially with my son, so there weren't many issues, but because there were so many of us living in the property, a number of factors contributed towards that. So laundry. One of the reasons why people have damp and condensation in their properties is because, it's to do with the windows, to do with the density or the type of materials, the walls. But if you are, for example, you are doing your laundry at home, and you don't have a dryer, then that means, you know, you're circulating hot air moisture into the air.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that escalated because at the time it was just the four of us, my wife, my son, her son, but then we had two children. So there were six of us. Yeah, six people living in a two bedroom property. So if you're washing and cleaning, and as I was doing a lot of fitness training, you know, a lot of training gear and all that, and the boys are doing those sports and all that kind stuff, you know, that, that just doesn't… It becomes more problematic. Does that make sense?

Yeah, it did. So before we formed as a group, there were previous incarnations of it, if you like, but they weren’t, generally speak, dealing with the issue. And it’s as difficult now, if I’m honest with you, youknow, we've had Covid, so getting things resolved as a committee just has been a bit difficult, you know. There’s – the level of apathy on the estate is very, very high, very high. And that is the case of all housing estates across the UK. So, we would leaflet all of the properties on the estate for meetings, and have our meetings on a monthly basis, and find that it would be the same people that would come to the meetings. And it would probably be 10, 15 people at most by the turn up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo despite the fact that somebody may be undergoing very serious issues which are influencing their mental health and wellbeing, they're unprepared to come out, to work as one collected unit to deal with it. Because they're just so disheartened and so downtrodden, and they just live with it, you know, they live with it and it's a real sad state of affairs, it really is. Because there are people on this estate, who are just sitting with it, you know, and you can knock on their door and you can hear them approach the door, but they won't answer it. And won't talk to you. They just go, they've shuffled back into their room and carry on watching, telly, you know. And, uh, you know, what happened on Eastfields, I would say that it’s not different to any other housing estate, or many other housing estates in, the UK. Because we were doing the same thing as they were. Well as Kwajo was doing, you know, so I'm in touch with I'm in touch on a daily basis with Eastfields and Ravensbry, who are the other two estates, as to what's happening on their sites, if you like. And yeah, people are really upset about what's happening. They don't like it at all. They feel they're not being listened to by anyone.

point to do now, because you just brought up Eastfields. Cause obviously Eastfields got a lot of news coverage and I suppose public awareness or public attention – on the estate, and more broadly, on Clarion as a housing provider. Do you feel that any of that news attention helped change things in your situation, in High Path Estate?

It's difficult to quantify that because I think on the outside, a lot of people think because we're being regenerated that we're, you know, and everything is fine and there's no issue whatsoever. You know, the news item that Eastfields put out there, if I'm honest with you didn't really make much of a difference to what was happening to us in our particular case. What tends to happen with Clarion, or Circle or whoever it is that they're called – we used to call them Circus, that's how disparaging things are – what tends to happen with them. The moment they get a bit of bad news, they send out the fire brigade, right? Or a team of builders and their head surveyor to assess the situation, stick around for a few months and then they go, so they would just firefight the things that are happening and really rising in terms of public attention. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat's happening on Eastfields at the moment. I mean, it's unfortunate, it's really unfortunate what's happening to them, but as the estate that has been cited for regeneration, that particular problem is gonna go away. And everybody will forget about it. I think what ought to be happening is that work needs to be put in place on all of the housing estates around the country. You know, basically a survey, the government ought to be undertaking a survey as to what it is that people feel is happening on their estates, pesently right now, this moment in time. And I'm referring to repairs and maintenance antisocial behaviour or anything else like that, just repairs and maintenance. Because I think what you'll find is that they would relay the same story as us, as us and as Eastfields and as Ravensby have done. They wouldn't say anything different from, if I’m frank with you, that there is a very poor line of communication between them and the landlord, and things just aren't being delivered in the timeline that they say they ought.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, you know, Clarion are very good when it comes to saying, oh yes, you know, we had 100 calls on Monday and we responded to 99% of them. You know, what's the response? A response is picking up call, you know, that's a response. And so people go, oh look, 99% of them. That means they must do really well. No, I wanna see, you know, the outputs. That's what I wanna see. And I think if they're delivering on that on a consistent basis, then that works. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe biggest problem we have in this country – and I'll give you my flag in the ground moment – the biggest problem we have in the country regarding this is that we have got a shortfall of skills. There weren't enough skilled people to deliver this kind of work. And I know this because of the nature of what I do in my present job. You know, I'm not just saying it just cause I read something in the newspaper. I notice the data is there, the facts are there, there arent’t enough skilled people to do the kind of work that needs to be done on the homes in this country. In this country, we have got the worst set of housing in Europe, in this country, the worst set. And that's not a claim you wanna be proud of if you are the Government in power, you know, you wanna be saying, hang on a minute, that’s not ok. We're also one of the richest economies in the world, so why is it the two aren't going together? There's something amiss. There's something wrong. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd it really stems the problem stems from, again, I don't into fall into politics, but you know, the Government really needs to look at what their priorities are, at the moment. At the moment they've got to prioritise that, you know, I appreciate NHS needs a lot of assistance, but, um, the NHS problems sometimes, in some cases, stems from housing. You know, if a person is living in a home that has damp and condensation and they're breathing in the mould from the wall, they then become ill, which means they then go to the NHS. If they're suffering from mental health issues, because they can't get through to their Councillor, because of the damp and condensation in their homes, they then go to the NHS, you know. So the NHS’s problems would probably be halved if we sort out the housing – simple as that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd the reason why this country does not wanna sort out the housing is because it's a different mindset. They've got to change their mindset. So instead of building homes in concrete, you build with low carbon, but they won't build with low carbon because the biggest donors for the party in power come from the construction sector and they want for their type of construction to continue. It's a conversation that has been happening for some time. And it's now time to, to change and deliver something. |\n|      | REDACTED                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Dave | It's really sad, isn't it, to think this is all happening right, under your feet, right in front of you, you know? Um, and I feel really, really sad for a lot of people who just can’t seem to get it. So when it comes to general election, they go to vote for what's name thinking, oh right, he's gonna make our lives better. Not realising hang on a minute, he’s just gonna screw you over. They just can't see it, you know, they can't. And it's coming around to hit people now because it's affecting them – if you ever, ever wanna affect somebody, or hurt someone, pick them in their pocket, in the wallet, in their bank account, you know, it’s not slapping them in the face or pushing down a flight stairs, it's in their pocket.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd a lot of people now are being hit in the pocket and they're seeing what's what, you know, because of the energy crisis they're seeing what's happening right before them. And if this was put to the powers that be at a very high level, I genuinely believe that people would jump on board having low carbon materials as a way to live, as opposed to living what life we're living at the moment. You know, right now, um, on these new builds, you know, I did ask for them to build up with certain materials. I feel, in 50 years time, we will have the same problems that we had in the old towers that we were living in before. So this is a seven tower building that I'm living in now. The one I lived in before was 11 stories. And I'm not entirely convinced right now, you know, that these homes will perform at a better rate than the ones that we are living in.

If so, I’ll start a new call.

So what I was gonna say was that, yeah, it's the chicken and egg situation, you know, that we find ourselves in. Okay. The powers that be, and let's face it, okay, people have the power, they can decide what they wanna do, but given the way we live in this kind democracy, people seem to feel it’s the government who should do that. Right. And I have felt for some time, and this is mainly because of my involvement in all of this, but the way forward to deliver the kind of phones that people – I'm talking about, social rented homes – that people want, it needs to be done through a community led scheme. And what that amounts to essentially is the community come together, and decide how they want to design the home. The price they want for those homes to be built at. So essentially what it means is that they work with the architects, they work with the builders, they work with the local authority to deliver this. Now I know, and I don't – I would say, don’t note this, this is private.

Twitter feed for High Path, there are two or three things I really want to engage with. It’s do do with the energy of the homes, and I'm talking about, you know, the kind of fabric of the home, and community organisation, you know, people working together. And I noted that in London, there was a group called RUSS Lewisham, and they stand for Rural Urban Synthesis Society and they are based in Lewisham and they are the top London organisation. It's residents, they’ve got together and decided they're gonna build their homes. What a beautiful way to go about living in your community. You know, now it doesn't mean that they go in with a shovel or hammer and do the stuff. If you wanna do that and get involved in that respect, that's fine. That's up to. But you go about finding the funding. You go about doing all this, but you're doing it with an authority that supports you. I was a member of that organisation – I stopped very recently because I was just doing too much – but I joined them in their quest. So I was the communications person for them. And I was checking out all this stuff on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram on their behalf. And you could see, and I was very jealous, really jealous. Cause I could see the relationship they had with their architects, the relationship they had with their builders, the Council, with the Councillors, the MP, all of those people who are integral, you know, working as one to deliver this project. And it's now got to a point, they were given a million pounds by the mayor of London. To go about delivering this project, you know, but my local authority would never undertake this kind of thing because it's a different political project, you know, they feel that right, okay, well it couldn't be done or we dunno how to do this or whatever, but it just kind of, you know, once you get entrenched into it, it becomes really quite murky and messy and you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I put myself forward. People were saying to me, why didn't you become a Councillor? I thought, right, put myself forward as a Councillor and the leader of the Council said to me, well you can’t, you haven’t been in the party for long enough, which was a load of rubbish. I thought you don't want me, because you know what I’m like, that's what it boiled down to. Other people were allowed in because they agreed with her form of politics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e So I'll start, I'll go back to what I said right in the beginning, or near the beginning, is that it's so political as to how things are being delivered and where they are and where they go, you know? And the homes that people need and want can be delivered in a very simple manner, in a simple way, but too many people wanna become the middleman. And it's because of that, we pay the price.

Dave | I mean, I see my role, you know, cause when people reach out to me, I don't just wanna say, yeah, you know, the housing association were rubbish, the Council were rubbish, blah, blah, blah. I know why they were rubbish, but you know, I need to contextualise it and also give a positive outcome of what can be done, as opposed to just, you know, rubbishing them and putting them. Because it means, okay, you might not wanna factor this in your, in your work, in your studies, in your thesis, but there are alternative solutions to these problems. It's not a case of saying, oh yeah, we want more money. The stuff is there.

rough last few years, where I was living in Bow for a long time. I was married before, living with my ex in Bow, and then I had a mental health issue and we broke up and then I lived with my parents for a year in Croydon, and they still lived there. And then I lived in – so that was for about 10 months – and then I lived in Honor Oak Park, for six months. So I moved into Honor Oak Park, maybe May? May 2020, and we started looking in August, and we found this immediately. We were like, this is good and it's more affordable and it's by the river. Because it's on an ex council estate. So we were looking, we literally, I think it was the month of, you know, started looking in July and then found it, and we made an offer in August. And then we moved in, in December. So it was pretty quick and we were just like – cos my friend just mentioned it, I was like looking for studio places on my own, cause I owned a flat with my ex in Bow. And then yeah, um, when we, yeah, when he bought me out, I had a bit of money, but I couldn't find anything for like living on my own. It was impossible. And even like the smallest places. So it's like really against you, if you are single. Like the housing market, I was like, I'm not gonna be with someone just because… And then my friend just mentioned, we were just in a park and she was like, why don't we get somewhere together? And I was like, that's not a bad idea. And then we – and then there was also the, you know, the – we didn't have to pay stamp duty. Then there was a big, uh, rush. But it was, it was good because it would've been very, yeah. So that's the story. It's kind of been a bit of a… But I mean, I'm very lucky to live here. I do really like, even though there's damp issues, it's still, it's still…. Yeah. It was good for my mental health basically. I could go into it, I don't know if you want to talk about mental health, I'm quite open to talk about it, but I also realise that I overshare sometimes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Me     | No, it's completely up to you on that.

Cause obviously I feel like that's becoming more of a common thing to do as well. it's just so hard, I guess like both in terms of like say buying somewhere, but also in terms of like renting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Milena | Yeah, I think I know a couple of people that do that.

It was gradual. But I did suddenly notice because I painted my room in January and then I think it was like a month after then that I started noticing like, oh, this is not good. I think it was a creeping thing though. I don't know. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I can't remember if it was to do with rain, I don't think so. But I was wondering cos when we - this sounds really ditzy – but when we moved in, like we got this heating thermostat. We dunno how the hell – it's like one of those things when… Yeah, we dunno how to, so we asked the previous owners like how do we work this? Because we wanna turn down the heating or like, I don't know, control it centrally. So now we've just been like putting it right. We dunno how to type, put it on a timer or anything like that. And we need to ask – even the boiler person didn't know. So it's kind of these, one of these really annoying things. It's just really like mystifying. And so we've just been keeping it low. So cause we don't wanna keep it, because we can't put the timer on all night, I mean timers it's on certain times of the night, I'm just sleeping in the cold that during the night when I should probably have the heating on. But we just didn't – cause it's so expensive to have it on all night and we don't wanna, so we still haven't worked out properly how to do that, but I probably should. And I don't know if I ever asked actually the previous owners, if they had issues with damp, or whether they actually properly put the heating on and that's why they didn't have issues. So it's probably my fault with not working out how to decipher the heating.

So there's like a waiting list with garages. It's not necessary that the garage that you have, it's like next to your house. It's just, I think you apply for it the same way with like cycling – there's like a cycling storage thing as well. People apply for that too. It could have something where like, there's something in the garage causing it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I could tell you all about, like trying to get the council to fix – oh, did you know there's a leak? I didn't show you this, but that's not damp. That's a leak. But that's in the kitchen. There's a massive problem with the pointing or… that's why we have scaffolding. I didn't even know. My dad is explaining cause he's architect, but he was explaining to me what it was. I still didn't quite understand, but there was like an issue with the balcony upstairs or like a leak, but that's, I guess that's not damp. But it was still, like, I just, I haven't even bothered with my room because I'm just, that's like more of a priority. Cause the ceiling's literally caved in. Not like completely as a whole, but you know, it's crumbling and I just haven't even bothered with the Council, cause I'm just, it's taking us a year to, and it's still not sorted just because there's been a backlog. But they've had, this is the problem with, I mean, you probably agree, outsourcing everything. It’s like, the different contractors don’t talk to each other. We get asked the same question by different people. And it's like, this isn't efficient, like at all, to have all this outsourcing. The issue I had was like, I don't mind if there's a delay, but just tell me, just tell me. There's… the communication is horrendous, like with these kind of things. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I have no hope with the, I mean, I haven't even bothered with a damp in my room. But it's just like, when you feel like… It's like a… I dunno if it is the right book, but I haven't read it, but The Trail. Is that, is that, is that what it's about?

And it's all lost. Like, and you don't know who to talk to and you're lost in bureaucracy. There's no, like everything's very faceless. Like Ruth Gordon, the Councillor. She's pretty good at chasing, but there's only so much she can do. So I probably should read that book, but I feel like it's about that. And I just like, who do I talk to?

Yeah. It's like… I feel, I don't actually know, but I'm guessing they have less accountability if they're at arms length. I don't know. I probably should research that, but everything just seems majorly complicated. I mean, the fact that there will be reports done, and then they'll ask me the same question.

 |\n| Milena | Months and months, like maybe nine months. So it's just like, we just, just, if we just had communication to say we're poorly resourced, you can't do this right now, it will take this long. I would be fine with that. It's just the fact that it’s so faceless and there's no communication with anyone and you feel like you're screaming into a void. You're like, and again, like it's not a majorly – I had basically, it was quite stressful. We were kind of using the [mental health](cause-effect-affect/mental-health) card, which is not completely crazy. But basically I had, when I broke up with my husband, I had, this was 2019, I had psychosis and I had what was called a manic episode. Anyway, so that was the first time, but then I got it again, cause I never had any mental issues before. And then I got it again at the beginning of last year. And this was like very stressful at the time being like, I remember being – cause you are very paranoid, you’re very delusional, you're kind of suspicious of a lot of things. So dealing with these people was just like, really like what the hell. And so my care coordinator was just like, you should probably say that this is affecting your health and like, you can't help, but still it's like, I don't know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Me     | And did you feel like it was affecting your mental health?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Milena | Sorry, that probably sounds really wrong, but you just like – Maria was my care coordinator at the NHS was saying that I should mention that. And it's not, that sounds like it was like a conniving thing, but I was also like, it has, but I almost saw that as like, you should mention that as well. But I think I was just like, oh, it's just another thing. Background stress. But it's just another thing to sort out. And there were so many other things that I kind of like… But the point is that, yeah, you shouldn't have to worry about those things. But again, it's like not a major issue. Like I live in fairly comfortable accommodation. It's not… But I remember just getting lost in all these emails and just being like, what the hell is going on.

But basically, my dad's came here once and I cut his hair on the balcony and some hair drifted over the balcony next door, apparently, but we cleaned it all up. Anyway, we got a letter in the post from the council. Saying that next door were complaining about the fact that some hair had wafted over to their balcony. And like, you've literally, at lightning speed, sent this letter about a little bit of hair, which I don't think even… And it was just, you know what I mean? It was like, I can't believe this is real.

I was just like, what is going on at the council? I don't know. And I just – we even got David Lammy involved. David Lammy’s office. Like my care coordinator. It wasn't him who messaged, but like his office. And it's just like – but it shouldn't – just tell us what's happening.

Yeah. No, they did. It was a bit better. I think it helped with my care coordinator, and I think David Lamy helped. I mean having said that, it’s still – it's gone back down again, like they've done a bit of work and we were like, are you gonna take it down? Is it finished? I keep asking. Is it finished? And they’re kind of like, we’ll pass on the message. Don't you have reports that tell you what's happening? I just, or like, I don't know. And also the people downstairs, they've got scaffolding in their garden for ages. It's not even their problem, and they have to be putting up with, you know. So again, it's not the worst thing in the world, but you're like, imagine if you had a major, major issue and that people behave like that. I can't imagine what it's like with other tenants or people, you know, I dunno what it's like with council housing, if there's priority there. I don't know. I don't know what the treatment was like with the guy upstairs. He's one of the few council tenants that's left.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Me     | So are most of the other tenants, or people who live here –                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Milena | Private, yeah. Interesting story about the guy. So the people who lived here before, there were a couple with twins. The guy, he'd been here since he was six months old. And he was, he's like around 40 now. And his parents bought the flat with [Right to Buy](cause-effect-affect/right-to-buy), but he just stayed here all that time and like bought – I think him and his sister bought the flat off the parents, and then him and his wife bought the flat. So he's been here a while. But I think they liked it, but they just said that it was just the twins. It was too small for them, but I don't know. Yeah… Lorna... I shouldn't really say, but there's some characters on the estate. It's funny. It's certainly like, it's certainly interesting. And like, they, the people who've been here for quite a while… But yeah, other people have complained about damp.

If the water impacts it somehow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Milena | Yeah.

Or like the boats outside. What's wrong with the boats? And then there'll be another lady that will like argue with another one about her being really petty. And it's just funny what people worry about. I mean, generally I'm quite… But people get so – like not nosy, but they're just things that I wouldn't even think about worrying about. But this is just quite, this is different. Cause it's like ceiling falling in like, or like damp in your room. That's not – and if, [especially if your clothes](cause-effect-affect/damage-to-belongings) – it's not, it's not ideal. But again, like, there is a lot going on in my life. Like I still don't worry about it too much. It doesn't affect me too much. I don't think. But I’m sure it could get really annoying, especially if the Council is so slow to respond, it could get really difficult for people. It is just another stress. But I don't know if like… \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a friend that lives a few doors down, he's actually a Syrian refugee, but he's leaving now. The flat. But he had problems as well, with damp. But yeah, I think… But yeah. It just highlights the problems that there are with the Council. I heard there's even problems with like – actually, “even” – Kensington and Chelsea. But then obviously they were neglecting the biggest housing disaster for the last, I don't know, a hundred years. I don't know. But they're just saying it's across a lot of Councils where it's just kind of… My friend who lives in Lambeth, who I was in Brixton yesterday with, has a similar thing with her kitchen. There's like a massive damp leak. And she said the same thing. There was like all these different contractors and then didn't speak to each other and they were asking the same question. Like, that's exactly the same thing that happens to me. And she's actually in an ex council estate as well. She's a private renter.

I bought like anti mould paints. But when it kept going black, I just felt really dirty. Like, I've got this in my room. I just need like a place – with everything that's happened in the last few – I just like, I need a place where I can just feel like things are – I have a lot of clutter – but just things are at peace, where I don't have to worry about doing that. It's still not that bad, but you just… Yeah, it doesn't make you feel very nice. Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Me     | And do you work from home a lot as well?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Milena | Well, in my last job, when I was working for this consultancy, I was working from home most of the time, not coming into the office that much at all. But now I work for the Trust. I was gonna try, well… Cause I'd actually, it's a nice flat, but I don't… I try and avoid working from home if I can. Cause I don't actually enjoy it very much. I feel like I've spent enough time on my own. I mean I have my housemate, but what I mean is I don’t… Yeah, I think everyone, I don't know. I personally like being in a co-working space. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYeah, I think... I got, well, after I had my second psychosis psychotic, I've only had two as I, and then I got diagnosed with bipolar. But I had like a really high point, and then after that I got really depressed after. So in the summer, last year I was really depressed and like, anything like to do with the house, like being in the house, was just like stressful. And you'd become, like – everything was just worse because you were just… You was here all the time and you internalised everything. And then if you just went outside and you were just like, oh, there's life outside and life isn't that bad. But it's hard to know if it was because of the pandemic easing up that I got better or because of a job change or because of now that I start taking lithium, which is to kind of manage your mood. I don't, I can't believe I was that low. Like I was really sad. And I don't know if it was to do with like, being inside all the time. Working from home doesn't suit me, working from a laptop. I mean, everyone has to work from a laptop, but I mean, just getting up in the morning and going and sitting in the kitchen all here to. And it was – some people don't even have that space. You know, I have lucky that I have that space. So I was just like, this is really bad for me, you know, that's not really to do with damp. But yeah, this is just, it's just one of those things of like, it seems much worse when you're constantly in the same place all the time. And so yeah, the damp, if I was, if I'm out, like now I don't really work,  I try and go out as much as possible. I'm always going to gigs or trying to just stay out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so I don't really, I'm not too precious about… I like to keep a home nice, but I'm not like home is my life. Whereas people – we kind of got a bit of a society where everything is about the home. I know I'm a homeowner. But like, I'm not interested in necessarily making money. I was just like, if I can do it. But it's just this idea that everything is about the house. Like buying stuff for the house.

I remember like we were renting this – me and my ex – we were renting a shitty, really shitty apartment in Whitechapel. It was really… Like they didn't do any work to it at all. And they would just up the rent every year. And you're like, what's the reason for this? They'd just be like, well, the market. And it's just like, you've literally done nothing to this place and it really needs work. And I was just like, I dunno, I just… It's like a control thing, like having some… But then even, you know, it sounds like even renting from the Council, if you have social housing, they behave like that, because they're the landlord, and maybe it's the same for council housing as well. Like cause they're the freeholder here, the council's a freeholder. I dunno what it's like for people with live in social housing, which is obviously really hard to get. And also I didn't like the idea of, like we are subsidising private landlords. Like the government is giving money to landlords instead of building social housing.It's so much more expensive to do that than just building like the housing. And I just didn't like that people were just like… Like, I'm not interested in that, I just wanna live here. I want to be part of the community. I don't see it as like an asset.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike I wouldn't care if I didn't make any money off this place. I just a… It is security that.

I definitely feel insecure dealing with the council for sure. I feel like it's talking to a void. I know that councils have had major cuts and I don't know, but I don't know what's going on. It's just so… It feels like smoke mirrors. Like you don't really know – it's very… You are dealing with so many different people. So that doesn't make me feel very… But you know what? It was the same when I was – so, the flat I owned in Bow, it was like a private management company that was managing things and it was also quite bad to deal with. So it's not necessarily that the Council's any worse.

The software we had to report it. You tried calling, but you just would never get through. The reporting tool online was just so clunky and difficult to use. And then you'd send a request and you had… You don't know, you were sent to requests and you didn't know, you didn't have proper record as to what, where it was like, you had no visibility as to where it was in the queue. And, yeah, I think the thing they could have improved is communication – the status of things. And communication amongst the people that are working on the particular issue, between each other. So reports are made, but they're obviously not read by the next person who has to deal with the issue. So they use different contractors. They should be able to have access to the reporting, surely?  And also, I think there's negligence in terms of clarity in reporting. Like they would miss off information and so on. So yeah, I think communication and just clarity would be helpful, you know?

I just reached out to people in the group and Lorna, but she was an ex Councillor. I thought that she could help. And then she put me in touch with the managing director of Homes for Haringey. Ruth Gordon was good. I dunno how he got in touch with Ruth. I think  Lorna also told me about Ruth. I should have, I mean, I could have just looked up the local Councillor. Ruth was saying how embarrassing it was. She was just like, what's going on? So this clearly just me, like, it's not my imagination. Like it's clearly not good. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut then Ruth did come back and say there's been issues everywhere, with like delays and it's like a backlog of work. I dunno if it's just the pandemic who knows. It's just really… I just feel like there's so many people involved and it shouldn't, you should have like, again, like we had one point of contact, but then they change and it just seems… I dunno how they – what the governance is or like how it's managed. Like, it just seems very confusing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Me     | Is there anything else you wanna mention or bring up?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Milena    | I guess I'm just… I feel like generally people, like, I feel like it's a very like isolating experience. Or you realise how isolated people are. Generally. I feel there's not very good… Like, yeah. As someone who like, obviously being no longer in a relationship, I was just like, suddenly I wanna reach out to people. I want to like build it, or I want to be part of a community. I want to know people that I deal with or like try and create some kind of sense of like, solidarity amongst… Oh, you know, and when it feels like no one has time for anyone else or like… It's just like, you should know the people you're dealing with at a Council. They should be visible. I feel like everyone is invisible. I’m not saying like everything about community is good. Like sometimes people can be too nosy or like too involved in other people's lives. But I just feel like it's really hard to kind of develop a rapport with others or get to know people, like make people feel like they care about each other. You know what I mean? I just feel like… Cause I care about those things. I just feel like it doesn't feel there's much of a caring. I don't know if it's because it's a place where it's a very transient place to live – London in general. But then a lot of people have been here for many years. But yeah, it's just, you just feel a bit invisible and you're really trying and yeah. So I just feel like it'd be nice if there was more of a sense of feeling cared for, and also you give care. You know, that's what I want.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|        | \u003cb\u003eREDACTED\u003c/b\u003e                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T08:07:36.327392357Z","tags":null},"/testimony/interview3":{"title":"Interview 03","content":"\nTranscript from interview [survey respondent](testimony/SR082), Alex.

Um, this was before –  so I moved out in, um, 2020. And so I was put in a, um, foster care placement.But, um, well, my relationship with my mum has since improved. So, um, I've been helping him with her damp issue as well, as of last year.

Is that like, it became a problem last year or, or that's just that the relationship has got better?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Alex     | So, um, we moved into that flat. So that flat is a three bed flat. And we moved in 2018. We had already started seeing problems, um, with the bathroom, um, especially with like the type of paint, um, that was used because it wasn't waterproof. So, um, I mean, we didn't really think much of it. And Lambeth Council is, like, really poor in terms of, um, getting back with responses in terms of like repairs and stuff. So we just put up with it. But then as the months went by, and then like the more showers that we were having, we started noticing like this… There was already mould there, but it wasn't like as noticeable, but then the mould was just like, riddled like the whole ceiling. And it got to the point where, um, mouldy paint started like dropping off from the ceiling and falling on us when we were showering. Um, and we just, like, needed to address it because, you know, it's just like really unsafe. We contacted the council, um, I believe this was in like 2019, but then nothing came off of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo we were calling and calling and calling and they said, you know, we'll book appointments, engineers will come to the property to have a look. Engineers did come, but then nothing would come off of it. They'd say, oh, we'll rebook an appointment, someone else will come in to sort out the issue, and we'd never hear from them again. And then we're back at square one and we have to start all over again. So it was just like an endless cycle. In my room as well, I did have an issue with damp. I tried ventilating my room as much as possible. But it just kept growing and I didn't understand why. We used mould sprays. We'd used [dehumidifiers](cause-effect-affect/dehumidifier), nothing was working.

And it was in my brother's room. So this was an actual, like three beds, semidetached house. It was really nice. I didn't think that like any problem would arise compared to like all the other places that we've lived in, in temporary accommodation with housing associations. But in my brother's room, I think he could only like sleep there for like two or three months until like mould had riddled like the whole room from like the carpet, the walls, the ceiling, like, it was just like really, really bad. And the mould got into… So my brother moved out of that room and was sleeping with my mum. Um, and like, we just put like furniture in there for storage as well.

So it was like less than a hundred pounds, which was lucky for us because like dehumidifiers – a good dehumidifier – is above, like in the hundreds. They didn't really give us advice. It only seemed like they were there to kind of pretty much collect the money  that they were going to be paid for that slot. I think my mum was just researching like her own options in terms of like, how to deal with mould and damp. When the pain started like dropping on us, when we were showering, my mum took it up on herself to, um, remove all of the paint before like more pain started falling off. So the ceiling was pretty much bare. Also the walls in the bathroom had mould in it as well. So she would try to treat it with bleach. So like, I think like once a month, she would like really go into it, try to bleach everything to make sure that the mould wouldn't spread, but then it would just come back again. The same with my room as well. She encouraged me to like bleach where the mould was. But then again, the same problem. So yeah.

Um, were there other, any other organisations, other than your council or the MP who you reached out to at any point? So like, um, residents, associations, renting unions, um, different charities or things like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Alex     | Mm-hmm, um. My mum was looking into legal options. But I just told her, like, you know, we don't really have like much like to stand on because of the fact that like, it keeps going back to square one and we haven't like actually had… Well, what I basically wanted to do was like, kind of like build a mountain of evidence so that it was overwhelmingly in our favour, rather than it being very balanced between us and the Council. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also was talking to my mum about like, maybe getting into contact with Kwajo Housing, on Twitter. Because like he'd been doing an amazing job in calling out Councils and housing associations in terms of like how poorly they treat their tenants in terms of like repairing certain situations. And like some of the damp that I'd seen and that he'd like, took pictures of, took videos of, I just thought like, you know, maybe ours isn't as bad, but it's still worth a try. But my mum didn't feel comfortable doing that, so we just stayed with like contacting our MP and the Council. So yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Me       | It’s interesting you're saying about your mum not feeling comfortable with that. Was that because of, kind of it then becoming a really public thing on like social media and stuff, or was there another reason she wasn’t keen?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Alex     | Um, I think it was mainly like the publicity. She really didn't want, she didn't feel comfortable doing that, and... I guess she was too proud to kind of ask for help on that level? Yeah, I mean, it makes sense, like why she wouldn't do that. But I just thought, like, you know, if, I mean, he's had an amazing track record in like getting, um, tenants’ issues sorted. So I thought like, you know, it might be worth a try, but yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Me       | Yeah, for sure. I really understand that with social media in particular – it's so hard to know how many people will end up seeing it or where it will end up. Kind of following on to something similar to what you’re talking about here, I guess your mum feeling ‘too proud’ in terms of not wanting it to become this public thing. I know you also talked about feeling embarrassed for guests to see it. I was wondering if there was anything else you wanted to send that? Cause this is something that a lot of people I have talked to – it comes up a lot basically. Most people talk about this kind of like, yeah, embarrassment of having people around or not doing normal things you would do in the house. And I was wondering if there's anything more, you understand that?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Alex     | We've actually never invited a guest since we've lived here. Um, well she, since she's lived there as well. And, yeah. I mean, it kind of like, she always says like, you know, I'm gonna make the house nice so that I can finally be comfortable in like, inviting people round. It never happens. And I think also the bathroom is like the main, main thing. Because, so our toilet and our like bathroom is separate, but the sink is in the bathroom to wash your hands. So they're gonna be exposed to it anyway.

Sorry. I think you've talked about your brother in the previous temporary accommodation had a lot of damp in his room as well. I was wondering if any of you experienced any like health problems that you thought were related to it? So like allergies, asthma type things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Alex     | Not in the previous home. However, I did have a bit of a scare in 2018. So a few months after we moved in, and when there was like damp in the corner of my room. The doctors still don't know like what caused it, but I almost went into [anaphylactic shock](cause-effect-affect/Atopy). Yeah. And it's just, it was weird. So I woke up… like quite early in the morning, it was like four or 5:00 AM, and my lips felt really tight and stuff, but cos it was dark, I just thought, okay, this will just probably pass in the morning. But then I went back to sleep again. I woke up in the morning. My face was really swollen. Like I could barely – my eyesight was very blurry – I could barely fully open my eyes. My cheeks were swollen. My lips were very very swollen. I mean, when I went to see my mum in the morning, like she was just shocked, like why my face was like that. Um, and it was even more strange because I don't have any known apparent allergies. But I still had to go to school because GCSEs were coming up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut then. So this was like around, um, 7:30, it was mainly swollen around my face. By the time it was like 10 o'clock, it started like spreading to my neck and that's when it actually became like, like I need to go to A\u0026E. Then I managed to get there in time. Took some medication to reduce the swelling. But they couldn't find a cause of it. I did some allergy testing as well, and they put down like dust, um, pollen and… something else? Well dust and pollen were the main things. But I'm just thinking like dust and pollen could not have like seriously made me almost die. It just really didn't make any sense.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, yeah. I don't know. It's something I still think about today. And that's why I'm like very, very careful around… like places like that, you know.

Experience that emotionally, if that makes sense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Alex     | Hmmm, so when did I first get in contact with them? I think when we really took you seriously in November, um, last year. So I emailed… So I wanted to find the neighbourhood housing officer to kind of tackle this problem. First I tried calling her: no reply. I tried emailing her to which she responded. And then I like attached pictures and videos with evidence and stuff. Then. Nothing. For months on end. And I just got really annoyed at the fact that like… Lambeth Council, when like you're paying rent for pretty much an unsafe property. And like, if you stop paying rent for like one week they’re all over you, but they can't even treat a simple problem, which would improve the standard of living for the tenant. It’s just ridiculous. And when I got my MP involved, that's when they really started taking things seriously. But even then, like I contacted my MP… Actually I can have a quick look for you with my emails.

Found it. So I contacted my MP the first time in September. Oh, sorry. Yes. So I contacted my MP in September. Then I contacted my housing officer in November to see like, hello, like I've contacted my MP, please get onto this so that we can get this issues sorted as soon as possible. Yeah, but again, still nothing, which was just really frustrating as well. I also contacted my local Councillor, but… To be, she was useless to be honest, like she was just not doing anything. She said like, oh, I'm gonna be in contact with, Lambeth Council, blah, blah, blah, blah. To this day, I have not heard anything from her. So I just, honestly just can't be bothered with her. But it was just really, when she said like, oh, I can help you, blah, blah, blah. But like, you're not fulfilling that? Um, yeah, it was just, I mean, I understand like they have, like, they're inundated probably with so many emails and so many calls and so many meetings, but, um, it just doesn't make any sense, you know?

Did that feel worse than when you’re just ignored off the bat?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Alex     | Yeah. So, um, just to give you a bit more context around the timeframes and stuff, I'm just looking over my emails. Um, so. The neighbourhood housing officer, um, sent me an email and said like, we have been contacted by Councillor Scarlette O’Hara in relation to repairs needed in the bathroom. But then for some reason the pictures didn't attach to the email I sent. So I sent them back. This was in October. Didn't hear back till December. And I was just going back and forth, back and forth with like, uh, my Councillor, like saying like, hello… like, I still need your help with this. And sorry, I'm just quickly looking over. Yeah, so. October my Councillor contacts Lambeth Council about the repairs that need to be done. Lambeth Council ask for the pictures. I sent them. I don't hear back from Lambeth Council till December. In November, I send an email back to my Councillor saying, you know, I sent the pictures, I haven't heard anything, could you try getting in contact with them? Cause nothing's happening? A month later my Councillor replies and says like, can you update me on your situation? Have repairs been carried out now? I, of course, say no, nothing's happened. Then she says, okay, thanks for getting back to me. I will follow this up for you. Then I hear nothing. That's the last time I heard from her. And that was in, on the 26th of November. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSorry I’m just looking if I’ve missed anything. No, and that was it. And then I just stopped bothering with my Councillor and just moving onto my MP. And Helen Hayes has been amazing. I mean, I understand like the amount of emails and phone calls that she must be getting is probably triple or four times more. But like, she has been amazing in terms of like getting back, getting into contact, and actually like getting things done. But it's just really frustrating because like I understand – the last email I sent was on the 15th of December, which was around, probably parliamentary recess, where they go off after holidays for Christmas. But then like, like, hello, we're still like in an unsafe building, you know? Um, it's just really, really frustrating when I had to do all of that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|          | REDACTED                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Me       | Now back to, we were talking about what we were talking about with your MP. Something that I was wondering, because obviously, I feel like the press and stuff and thanks to people like Kwajo, you see MPs and politicians talking a lot more about bad conditions in social housing. Have you felt that there's, has there been any change for you in terms of like, does your Council seem more, or MP seem, quicker to reply or is it still the same? Has nothing really changed?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Alex     | I don't think anything's really changed to be honest. Even with Lambeth Council in terms of advice that they give to tenants. Like even for mine, when I signed my contract, I just realised that it was the same, pretty much the same thing as the contract that my mum got in terms of like, advice of like upkeep and things like that. And it said that try to limit condensation in your flat, because it's pretty much, if you get damp is pretty much your fault. Which I found a bit ridiculous because like, if you are getting a lot of condensation and you are getting a lot of damp in your flat, that means that like, for example, windows or like ventilation isn't structurally sound. And it should also be also maybe ok, not like fully the responsibility of the tenant, at least partly responsible with the Council of help to kind of resolve the issue. But the advice is still the same. And I think that Lambeth Council are pretty much like pushing back on it in terms of like, helping with these issues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut like when it gets really bad to the point where like a whole room's riddled with mould, it's pretty much like you have to step in, you know. And like with, especially with, um, people like Kwajo, where they're so pivotal in terms of like sparking change and getting media attention about it. It's just, yeah, it, I think it's like really, really key to have more people like him. First of all, to get MPs listening, issues like this and to resolve these issues quicker, before it becomes an issue that spirals out of control. I think also for housing associations and Councils, to make sure that they reply to tenants repair reports as quick as possible before, again, it spirals out of control. Because especially with our one. So, um, our bathroom floor has started collapsing. And so the bathroom floor is the ceiling to the hallway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd as you can see, I think, I hope you can imagine it. So it's really, I mean, I can pretty much put my hand into, onto the floor, onto the bathroom floor, from the entrance, if that makes sense. So it is really, really dangerous. And it's just been getting worse. I thought that you know, this being like an incredibly hazardous issue, I thought that like, you know, there would be all guns blazing, like, okay, let's get this sorted, we don't want any  injuries before they come for us in terms of compensation and things like that. I thought that's the response that they would take. Clearly not, now that it's taken like more than six months, you know? So yeah. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is really disappointing that housing is seen as almost like a privilege rather than a right. Especially  with like, um, council tenants, housing association tenants, and things like that. And also I've seen this weird debate about people being ungrateful for being in council housing, that's like in really poor condition. And almost being jealous of council housing because like, oh, I've bought my house, like, you know, for more than 400,000 pounds, you're living in a flat that's like 500 to 600 pounds a week, I mean, a month, you should be grateful for being in your condition, blah, blah, blah. Things like that. And it is really disappointing. And I wish like, things like that… Maybe just having like more empathy, you know, could help get these situations sorted, but yeah. Sorry. I've just ranted for a really long time. |\n| Me       | No, no, no, don't say sorry, don’t say sorry. That was super yeah. Interesting. And especially shocking, with this issue of the bathroom floor and hallway, It’s such a big hazard, so it's the sort of thing that you'd think maybe they would act quicker.

Is that something you get a sense of from social media or the news or somewhere else?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Alex     | Definitely social media and mainly Tik Tok. I feel like social media has just become like… Just this ugly thing where people can like, think that they're just anonymously – well, they pretty much are anonymously voicing their opinions – and thinking about there's no repercussions for their actions. But I'm just reading the comments and I'm just thinking like, this is the country that I live in. And it's just really disgusting and really disappointing that people think like this. Sure enough, like you are in a position where you are more well off, you could save more money for a deposit to put down onto a house. That’s fine. But then of course there are other people who aren't in that position. So I don't understand, like, what's the point of like going after council tenants rather than like, the landlords, the billionaire and millionaire investors from overseas who are buying up properties and like hiking up the prices to the point where it's almost unlivable and especially in London – and cities around the UK as well. It's almost like. Again, it’s this thinking of like, it's always from the top to the bottom and like it's causing like this infighting between people at the bottom so that it kind of distracts them from people at the top. And from the people at the top, I kind of mean like, um, millionaire and billionaire landlords, investors, people who just like… For example, like I think there was a council flat – there's people that buy really, um, pretty much derelicts council houses, and do them up really nicely, but like mark up the price to like ridiculously high. Like two and a half thousand pounds a month for like a two bed is just… it’s too much, you know? And like you're having more and more people sharing houses as well. Um, yeah, it’s, it's…. It's just really disappointing. And also like with Kwajo’s Twitter posts, I read the comments as well. And again, people are trying to shift the blame onto the tenant for those issues, like with infestations, with structural issues and things like that. It doesn't make any sense to me, you know? And I think that that's like the main, kind of like, not even the main factor, but like one of the factors why, I think that it takes so long for issues like just to get sorted as well. For council tenants. Um, yeah, I think if there's anything else, cause I had a point in my head, oh it’s gone…                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|          | REDACTED                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Alex     | Oh actually. It just made me think of council houses and people who've lived there long enough and decide to buy them. There’s also again, this like… Not really, not really stigma, but kind of like this pushback kind of like, oh, why are you buying council houses? If you can afford to buy your council house, then you can afford to buy elsewhere in London. You just leave these council houses for, to people who need this the most.And it's just like, it's always these opinions coming from people who bought their homes in sixties, seventies, eighties, nineties, where homes were incredibly cheap and more affordable, um, compared to now where it's like, what 10 times that, where I think the average house is like increased now to like 450 pounds, 450,000 pounds. It just doesn't make any sense to me because like, if you've lived there for long enough to the point where like you've been saving and you've been frugal, you sacrifice things to the point where you can finally enjoy having your own home with your name attached to it, rather than being attached to a landlord, a private landlord, or the council as your landlord, wouldn't everyone want to kind of like celebrate that? Yeah, it's just not nice to see, is it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Me       | Yeah, it's just it's so crazy how expensive everything is. So comments like, oh, well, if you can, if you could buy your counter flat, why can't you buy another flat in London? It's like, no one can buy a flat in London these days. I wanted to ask you, probably like coming to the last question, but we’ll have time for anything else you want to say at the end. I wanted to say first you’re so knowledgeable, it’s really inspiring.

So like, be it, private landlords, councils, housing associations, or different organisations that are in control or in power, to kind of see who is the best person to target. Cause of course you can't target the CEO. I mean, you can, but like it's rare that anything will come up with it. So that's kind of like how I've learned, to kind of tackle issues like this.

And I've seen a lot of these like spring up in and  around Lambeth. And it's really disappointing that like they are starting these projects, that are again, clearly being catered to a specific group of people, rather than using that money to reinvest into existing council tenants first, in terms of treating – even if it's like a small issue, that can like drastically improve someone's standard of living with Lambeth Council. Um, but it's just, again, it's just disappointing to see, because like, it's clear that Lambeth council are pushing towards like investors and millionaires and yeah… I just wish that they took the approach of treating their tenants first. Rather than people who've – um, and I don't mean this in like a discriminatory way in terms of like, people who've newly moved to Lambeth, um, being like at the back of the line – but I think that like, because there's such a backlog of so many report and repair issues, being left un-done or being left, even unseen. I think that must be tackled first rather than focusing and pumping money into developments like that, you know?

A few weeks. Actually lemme quickly check when it got treated. I think it got treated in May. Sorry, I said a few weeks, but it was actually a few months. Um, sorry. Yes, it was in June. So, um, it was treated in June. They’ve repainted everything. Well, they treated like the mould first. They repainted everything. I hope it was with waterproof paint, cos if not… God, I don't even want to think. Of like going all the way back to square one. But it looks so much better now. There were a few issues with the bathroom anyway. So we had like, a leakage as well. The bathtub wasn't draining properly. And we still have the bathroom floor collapsing as an issue that needs to get sorted. But at least that's one thing off our list. And I'm so, so happy with that. So yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Me       | Well thank you for sharing. It was really nice to hear. I feel like it's so nice to hear something positive sometimes. That’s great news and I hope the other stuff gets fixed as well.

|\n| Me   | So what I've been doing is to kind of help contextualise, especially, if the person I’m interviewing say doesn’t live in the house that had dam anymore is ask if you could start by telling me a bit about where you were living that had damp, like who you lived with, where whereabouts was it? That sort of thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| John | Yeah, so it was – I was living alone. I was very, very lucky. It seemed implausible, an implausible thing to happen. But I got this place that was a studio essentially, a studio flat. It was quite a large, I mean, for that kind of situation, it was quite a large living space. So I was, I was very lucky with it and lots of ways. Although I mean, the kitchenette and the shower room were absolutely tiny. And, you know, it's very shabby. I mean, I guess that's, you know, most places anyway, really isn't it rent in terms of renting in London. But very shabby and lots of flaws, which I knew when I took it on. But, yeah. Yeah. So it was like, yeah, I was very lucky in that situation anyway. It was in West Hampstead, so part of the borough of Camden, the comparatively posh bit of it. But if you – I mean, I think some people think when I say West Hampstead, they think Hamstead – it's not Hampstead, it's West Hampstead. I mean, it's, you know, it's closer to Kilburn than Hampstead. But it is nevertheless, fairly well to do likes, relatively speaking. And it's not as pricey. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e *INAUDIBLE.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Me   | That was super useful. You said you were renting privately. Was it through an estate agents? Like, were there property managers or was it kind of more direct to the landlord? In terms of like who you contacted or things like that?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| John | Yes, that’s a good question. It was direct to the landlords, but they kind of had – the landlords were a company, seemingly. They had an office, a very small office in Chalk Farm, but then quite often, the landlord would be sort of referred to by name, by correspondence. And the impression I had at the beginning was that it's through a company – well, it, it's not just an impression it was through a company – but it's obviously an extremely small company being run very directly by the landlord if that makes sense. Like the landlord obviously had a portfolio of properties, and he made enough to actually keep an office and employ a couple of members of staff. But it was directed to the landlord  essentially. I guess there was an error of an air of professionalism like you get with an agency, um, which is maybe relevant to my decision making but I can't really remember.

So if you lived there from 2012 to 2018, and I think you said to me you had the problem with damp for five years – so was that the majority of the time then that you were living at the flat?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| John | Yeah, it was the whole time really. It never went away. I can't remember if I was aware of it when I looked at the place. Probably not. Although I don’t – I can imagine, I might still have decided to take it on, even if I was aware of it. But yeah, I remember I raised it with the landlord quite early on. And I guess we'll get onto this maybe, but I basically ultimately decided to live with it essentially for a long while. Yeah. And I mean, they refused to resolve it essentially. And, in the end there were things I did to sort of help it, to help the issue. But essentially it was the whole.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Me   | And was there like, once you moved in, was there a kind of point where you noticed – where you  became aware of it as a problem? Or was it something that kind of gradually you became more aware, or it rained once and it got a lot worse or winter came and it got a lot worse?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| John | I think, uh, so I think probably fairly soon after I moved. I moved some furniture and realised it was an issue – it was quite visible in the walls in certain places. Probably been hidden to a degree. So I think that was quite evident then. And that's the point where I raised it. I think – I don't think I'd lived anywhere with damp before, lived in a place of other issues, and I don't – so at that point I didn't appreciate how much of an issue it was. So for one thing, like I heard later, like how it can affect your health in long term ways, which you may not be aware of. And that's something I don't think I was aware of then at all. I didn't know that. But also later much later on, I realised [it was damaging lots of my belongings](cause-effect-affect/damage-to-belongings). But early on at that stage, I didn't realise that was an issue. I sort of recognized… I mean, I thought of it as more of an aesthetic issue than anything else. You know, there's mould there and I thought, you know, it wasn't good. Like it implies other potentially other pests and vermin, I guess, maybe. And it's obviously something you don't want, but I didn't fully appreciate how much of an issue it was. So that's sort of a bit of context, but basically, yeah, I think more or less, as soon as I moved in, I realised there was an issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Me   | And you say later on you kind of became aware, so it was damaging your belongings and the impact it could have on your health.

Um, in terms of the health thing, I think it was just something I read somewhere or somebody said, I think it might have been something that, something I heard other people talk about. Possibly I've got one particular friend who's got, who's chronically ill with [asthma](cause-effect-affect/Asthma). And they talked to me about their experiences of living in a property. And they had something, which then later happened with me. And I think this is separate to the damp issue as such, but where the bathroom had bare wood work and the mushroom cropped up, they had that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo it was a bit less of a shock for me when it happened, because it happened to them before I'd heard about this issue. Byt yeah, they talked a lot about the chronic health issues, so I think it was probably particularly through them that I was aware of that as a notion. That it sort of can have long term effects and things that you may not, you know, there's never any acute health issue that I was aware of. But the notion that it can have invisible effects. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd in terms of property, I can't… I'm straining my memory a bit, but there was definitely a point where I realised [various things, particularly paper and leather items, I suddenly realised they were mouldy](cause-effect-affect/damage-to-belongings). And I think for a long time I didn't realise, just a lot of stuff, which was, you know, paper things, so lots of like notebooks and, and scrapbooks and things. I just had stacks up, which I never looked at really, they were just there. And some leather things were in there as well. And there was – I had like a leather bag, I think. And again, I wasn't really using it. It was just on a hook. And there's just this point where I suddenly realised, oh, no, like a significant portion of my things are mouldy, but all on the backside, especially if they're resting against the wall or what have you. And I hadn't appreciated – I mean, I guess it seems naive – but I don't think I appreciated how much it would transfer to things before that. And yeah, there was definitely a point where I had a bit of a panicked situation of recognising a very large part of things I own have been affected by it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Me   | I feel like it always shocks me when that happens.

Yeah. It feels like an issue with the property and, and of course the nature of rental property is that you’re a bit nomadic, you're moving around and everything, and you kind of think… It's the one, like there's a lot of bad things about it, but it’s the one thing which almost, I mean, it's not in itself a good thing in itself, but you can feel, at least, at least you've got mobility in that situation. At least you feel like you can just move on and just leave a place behind. Um, and there's an, an emotional sense of that as well as the literal physical aspect of that. And yeah, you sort of think of you and your belongings as being free of the property, I guess.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Me   | No. Yeah, for sure. I was wondering, so you obviously have moved out of the property now. Was the damp issues a motivating factor in doing so, or was it unrelated?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| John | It was, yeah, it was a moving factor. Though I was quite sick of the place and it took extra work. Cause I say like, I just got into this routine of like, routinely I’d scrub down the walls with soap and water, which did make a difference actually. But, and various bits of property, I would just make sure I, I started buying loads of silica gel and putting it in all my like drawers and boxes and things. Bought a [dehumidifier](cause-effect-affect/dehumidifier) all these sorts of things, these extra things I had to do – I got a bit sick of that and just the unpleasantness of it. But I would say that the main factor for me moving was other things really was, it was primarily – I mean, basically just struggling in life in general. And I managed to move to a place that was 10 minutes walk away from where I worked. Which meant a lot of sacrifices in various ways. I mean the place was literally – I never actually got otot measuring it, but the entire place was dramatically smaller than most bedrooms I think, absolutely tiny. And the walls – people talk about paper thin walls, but it was literally a partition between me and the next flat. It wasn't so much them disturbing me, but anything I did, the slightest thing I did disturbed them and they would bang on the walls. Lots of sacrifices to that place, but it allowed me to be 10 minutes walk from work. But that didn't have a particular issue with damp.

I guess I was very lucky with the place I found. Also, maybe partly how I looked, how I researched the type of place I looked for, but, yeah, I never actually viewed that many places when I moved. And since then I've moved in with family, since COVID I moved in with family, which again, I'm very lucky to be able to do. So I haven't actually had that much opportunity to do that. But I think I would be, yeah, I think I'll be a lot me, more acutely aware of the consequences of damp. It’s not necessarily that I would be more likely to spot it. I have to say, I don't think I know particularly why it happens in certain places and not in others, really. There was no obvious cause actually that I was aware of in that place – nothing visible. I guess I should actually learn about that really.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, saying that, I guess there was one place I viewed where – it was out of London, it was during COVID where I thought I could go somewhere where the rent is super cheap, and cos I was again very lucky to be working from home during COVID.  And suddenly I didn't have to be in London, and I viewed a place and it really suited me in so many ways. But I remember going in and as always, like, it looked far better in pictures than it did in reality. But I remember walking into a room and the windowsill, there was a hole in the windowsill. And it kind of rotted through and there was this big hole underneath it. And it didn't actually look, I mean, it looked, I mean, that's quite terrible and it did look terrible by itself, but it didn't look besides that as if there was any damp issue. It didn't look damp. I think I might have even touched it. And there was no evidence of damp as such. But it was really that, that one thing which stuck in my mind and made me decide, no, I'm not gonna take this place, even though it suited me a lot.

I wondered, I presume, because it was a studio flat, that there were other flats in the building around it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| John | Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's right. I mean, so on the ground floor, there were just two flats, mine and one other. I was on the ground floor. Both sort, quite largeish, but yeah, there were loads of flats upstairs. I mean, I didn't really get to see upstairs. It wasn't – didn't feel right to go up. But there were actually an quite astonishing number of them. I think I asked the landlord and, um, I might be confusing it with the place I moved into afterwards, but I think they said 17 flats, which is quite astonishing for a house, essentially a big house. Like it, I mean, it would have been a big house that had been sort of divided. And I think a lot of the flats must have been dramatically smaller than the one I was in. But, as I think about it, I think that might have been the place moved into afterwards. Nevertheless, there were a lot of people there in a house. But behind me, I think there might have been a basement underneath my flat, but I didn't have access to it, but I heard voices when the maintenance people were in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere was a little room, which was kind of an extension where the washing machine and everything was, nearish my flat, but it wasn't really connected to it directly. So I don't think that was a factor. Yeah, I think the main living space. So I guess, in terms of what caused it, part of it maybe was, the shower room and the kitchenette were in the corridor at the back. And they only had a very small window in the kitchen and no ventilation directly in the shower room. And they connected via just an open corridor to the living space, which is really big and which had quite a few windows. And I, you know, I keep windows open all the time pretty much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don't, um, this is what the landlord said when I raised it, they said, oh, you just need to keep the windows open when you have a shower, as they do. And that's all it is, but that wasn't all it was. I kept the windows open all the time. I like to have air and I struggle with heat. So windows nearly always opened for me except in the very, very depths of winter. So, yeah, so it may have been the way my own flat was organised. Maybe that caused it. But I assume, maybe brick work, or what have you. Because there wasn't an obvious cause I'd say.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Me   | I was wondering as well, when I was asking that, did you ever talk to other tenants who lived in the building or like get a sense that other people had similar problems?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| John | Yeah, the person, I mean, two different people over the course of the time I was there, but the people in the flat next to me, they did have issues as well. I think, uh, yes. People in the upstairs flats, I just tended not to – I mean, we saw each other a little bit – but I didn't have that many in depth conversations with them.

I did raise it, I think, I did push it. I raised it and they said the thing about, oh, you just need to keep your windows open. And I did push back on that saying it's more than that. I can't… I think they may even have just not responded at that. Which they did. I mean, I felt, again, according to the very low bar of expectations, you know, I felt fairly lucky that you could at least have a conversation with them to a point, and they were never sort of difficult as such more evasive. Sometimes just hard to get hold of, and what have you, but not like difficult or unpleasant. So I felt comparatively lucky and, yeah, I mean, it probably reflects badly on me, but I just guess I just generally took the attitude of I'd rather deal with things myself, then push for things and it maybe not get anywhere. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I, you know, I guess it's partly just how I dealt with life like partly just in general. I've found, and find, it easier just to not have to deal with people in general. But also just always struggled with, yeah, just managing life around working full time. Working full time was enough. Like I couldn't do much work to make hings work outside of work, basically. I just felt I couldn't do that. I just had to… and it was easier. And I guess it's hard to, um, understand decision making retrospectively, but at the time, I guess I was thinking, oh, there are things I can do. So I've got a little dehumidifier, it was only a little one, it didn't actually cost that much money, little dehumidifier and… to just scrub the walls. And as I say now, and again, and you know, mould is very easy to, you know, you can literally just scrub it off. It's horrible. Cause you get like black water everywhere, but you can just wipe it off. You know, it didn't even take that much work. Well, it did because there was a lot of wall space. You know, I could and did remove all the visible mould and really make a difference to the place. Just though a bit of work myself one afternoon doing that. So I guess my thinking at the time was, you know, there's things I can do and they're fairly easy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I don't like the landlords or the agents coming into my home. I'd rather they like – I wanna minimise them coming in. So if I can do things myself, I'd rather do things myself than have them coming in a lot of the time. That's just a general principle I used. And generally do. Sorry, but I've forgotten the question, to be honest, I went off on a little tangent. |\n|      | REDACTED                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| John | So they weren't totally – the landlords weren't as ridiculously unresponsive as some landlords are. But I could see that they were always going to sort of do things to the minimal level and to the cheapest level possible. You know, for example, the landlord – the council told them they had to put in more electrical sockets. There was some rule about how many sockets they put in and where they came in, they did it within an hour or two, just like plastic ducting along the wall, just extended, took a spur from existing circuits and added in sockets. You know, I could see everything was gonna be done to the absolute basic level. Even if they did something, they weren't going to, you know, damp proof the house. So it, you know, I think the calculation I made was I'd only be wasting my effort in trying to make something happen that isn't gonna happen. I should either find somewhere else to live, or stick with it to some degree.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Me   | I think something you said in your survey, and I think you've mentioned it a few times, about your friend not wanting to come over who had her chronic asthma health conditions. Something that I've noticed a lot when I talked to people, was people talking about not wanting people to come around or like feeling embarrassed or, yeah, not wanting visitors as much as they normally would. I was wondering, did you ever feel like that was the case for you? I guess not just in terms of your friend not wanting to come around, but also not wanting people around?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| John | Um, no. I don't think I did, to be honest. It wasn’t too, I can't really remember, but I don't know how visible it was if I kept on top of wiping the walls down, as I say, which I did, it was fairly easy to keep them clean. So I didn't look too bad. I mean, relatively speaking, the place didn’t look great. It was a bit shabby, you know, sort of laminate flooring. It was all kind of, you know, like fraying at the ends of the boards, that kind of thing. Just everything done really cheaply and simply. But it was an old, like, it was quite a nice looking house. They had these really unusually high ceilings and quite a nice shape.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt sort of had, not proper bay windows, but it was a bay shaped window, I think. And, I'm trying to remember, but it sort of looked relatively nice given that, you know renting in London, according to what I'm used to and what people I know are used to. It looked okay and it was very spacious. Yeah, so it looked okay. In terms of a short visit, it didn't occur to me that it would impact anybody's health. If I thought it would impact people's health, then that would be a different matter. But I guess I – or maybe I should have paid more attention to what my friend was saying. I mean, I respected their decision, but it didn't particularly occur to me that visiting for a few hours would be an issue really for anybody in terms of health and aesthetically, it wasn't that big of an issue basically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Me   | Oh, for sure.

So it was not last August, the one before. So I was living before then, um, me and my brother and my daughter in Camberwell, and we still had like quite a long time left on our lease, but this place has been on a long lease. So friends of ours took it, had a 10 year lease on it and they kind of did the conversion. So it was just a garage. And it's been changing throughout all that time. So you, you can even see in the studio, there's the kind of place where the it's like a pit in the ground and there's where the cars would come in. And that's what that thing was. But, yeah. So then over that 10 years, like lots of my friends have lived here and anyway, so I kind of knew lots of people who said, oh, it's coming up, you know, they're there, they're gonna step out, and the landlord was looking for somebody else. So yeah, we decided we – me and my brother – really wanted to move here because it was like in the middle of, you know, we'd had lockdowns, but it was COVID and where we were living was just, a really like, I didn't, you know, I was sleeping in the living room. There was literally no outdoor space at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was really hard with my daughter and I was just like, all I wanted was space. And so yeah, we took it on. But we had the really complicated thing of trying to get out of our previous lease. And that was so stressful. So then my best friend, from long time moved in, and my brother's old friend, Greg too. So there's now four of us, plus my daughter, it's four adults and Willa. And then cause there's the studio part we'd sublet or, you know, rent out to two artists as well. Yeah, but we are due to be moving out at the end of this summer.

So we had like this overlap time where we were paying double rent, and I guess it was also like, I dunno, it just felt like a really, really hectic time, because I guess because of COVID too, it just felt like there was like, it felt like quite few people with like trying to move into a tiny flat with no outdoor space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|       | REDACTED                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Hilda | That was, it was a really – it was really stressful. Our flat was – in a way, like when we had signed onto it was an unusually cheap flat because it was in really bad condition. And they were like, basically, and it was, you know, the landlord was also I think was quite a sweet guy who wasn't – you know, it was like some old family flat that he – I don't think it was like his income type thing. And he just wanted someone on the long lease and was like you can have it for quite cheap if you sign for a long lease and you do all of the… Because it was crazy, it was like, there were these massive holes in the wall and stuff, which we were fixing. And soin a way, you know, then we had done a lot of tidying up, it looked a lot nicer than when we took it. So I was initially like, oh, it'll be easy to get somebody to move in. It's a good rent, but yeah.

So two houses, two houses ago. So that also I was living with my daughter and my brother, and then my brother's partner at the time. And that was also in Camberwell. And so that would've been, oh God, about… So my daughter is now five, almost six, and she would've been like, between the ages of like one and a half, two, three sort of? I think we were only in that house for a year, but it was maybe one and a half to two and a half, would be, yeah…\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo about 2, 3 years ago. That doesn’t sound – anyway. Yeah it was like – I think the part that we were in had been an old type factory or something. And it was kind of amazing, the architecture. It was completely weird, but I also loved it. So that was the back part. And then they built newer houses into the kind of – they sort of extended the building into actually newer built bits that came forward. So it was almost like you come in and there was a car park, flat buildings around it, and then you went up some stairs into the older factory part of the building and there were a little mini courtyard with flats around it, and then up some more stairs and a kind of balcony ledge with flats around it. Almost like a wedding cake. It was genuinely really bizarre. I can show you pictures actually after, it’s called Hopewell Yard. And I loved it. The building and the flat itself. So ours was in that kind of courtyard on the second tier type section. So it was 1, 2, 3, 4 flats that all looked around this central bit. And it was nice, you know, people had flowers and like benches and we got really nice with our neighbours and stuff. And then it looked like a sort of shop front. It was just like all glass, like the whole front of our flat. So that was the living room, but then there was literally no other windows. That the courtyard that went onto the courtyard, and it was a small courtyard, so not much light came into it, but it was just huge and open. And then you sort of come back into the flat and it had this large living space and then three small bedrooms.                                                                                                                           |\n| Me    | None of which had windows?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Hilda | The window – all the bedrooms, the bedrooms did have windows, one window each. But they, you know, a month after we moved in a massive building development was like this far in front of the windows. And they had, it was kind of crazy, like there was –so there's this huge glass front thing there, then there was this kind of strange pillar, like the kind of house had, and I guess this was from the factory, these kind of pillar type beam things that would just randomly cut into a room. And then the wall that had the windows on in the bedrooms was all like exposed brick. And also the result of the glass window fronted living room was that there was no window that opened. So although in the living room, although it was sort of spacious and it felt in this weird kind of sense light, but not really, when it started to get damp it was like, there was literally no window you could open in that room. The only thing you could do would open the door, which we did obviously in the summer, but in the winter it's just fucking freezing. And it cold as well because of this thing. So it was a really weird combination of like cold, but so humid. And then the bedrooms, the exposed brick wall was just like a sponge. And so my brother and his girlfriend's room had one of these stupid beams in the middle and it was a tiny room, but there was this mezzanine thing that was built where the the space where our bed would be. So they had their bed on there, but that was against the thingy and their mattress just literally like disintegrated with mould. So they couldn't sleep on the mezzanine and then had to literally had to cut shape out of a double bed to fit a bed and then both have their legs. Like, it was just like not a functioning bedroom for two people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Me    | And then did you and your daughter have a room?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Hilda | So we had a room each, we put her in the middle section one because it was – the other ones had, you know, two exposed walls. And so she was in the middle one, which was the biggest room and she was in a cot at that time. But even so, yeah, even it, cause it, initially her cot was to the side of the room and her cot just like grew mould. So she, I had to have it in the middle of the room touching nothing. And then I was in the far one and my room was not as bad as Jack and Fran’s, but I would wake up like literally a soaking like, well, not soaking, but like a tangibly wet bed every day. And then yeah, the main part of the living  room space… It was just like a thing of like, you know, you would just wipe. You'd wipe it, and like three days later it was just like, like it just mushrooms back. And like, in a way with that room, I suppose, cause it was bigger, it was easier to manage in that you could see it around. And I did feel really worried about – cause me and my daughter were in the house a lot. I felt really worried. And she was ill. She was just ill throughout that whole winter. But it was more like, we could keep our stuff away or you didn't have to get so actually close to it.

I mean I actually loved the… And also, because it wasn't that all the buildings – like I was really keen and like desperate to actually just move into another flat in that yard. I remember calling estate agents in Camberwell being like, do you want any flats in Hopewell Yard? And they'd be like, oh, I have one in a street around the corner. And I said, no, I don't like that. I only like this one. Because it was just amazing. I think, and that's why I was kind of describing the space, like it, it was like, not like London architecture. It was like, yeah, we had neighbours from, you know, lot's of different places and somebody was saying, oh, this is more like South American Type arrangements. Which, I mean, I don't know, I've not been, but I sort of felt when I looked at it  like this doesn't really look like London and it was great. Cause it meant literally my kid would just go and be like in the flat with somebody, cos they play together and all the doors would go and they'd just go in and out of people's houses. And yeah, I was, I've never lived anywhere like that. No, it was so nice. It was really lovely. So I, yeah, I definitely liked it and, and you know, I did love the way the flat looked in some ways. I mean, the light thing was a bit of a problem, but you can get around it. It's kind of the same here, I suppose, the same sort of feeling where it's like, like windows and spacious, but sort of gloomy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Me    | And, you say none of the other flats had a problem, is that something you found from talking to the other residents?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Hilda | Yeah, so, I mean, I wouldn't say none of them did, but it was very specific ones. And so we were actually directly above – because of this thing, so you come in and there's the first car park and the flats around, and then you go up these little stairs to the second park where we were, that also is a dip down to an underground car park. So our flat was directly above the car, the underground car park. And so I think that was probably part one of the structural things. So the woman in the flat, directly above me, who'd been there for years and she had – her landlord was the same as mine – but she said, like, he knows, you know, this has been going on every single year. The tenants come, they have a terrible, terrible time. They complain, they leave, new people come.

So I did know one couple who moved into the – you know, who was like the equivalent version of our. Actually, and even our direct neighbours. But those ones, I think they were slightly forward, so that could have been a better thing. But it may well be that just – they were definitely just like done up nicer. You know, or like – because there were some things, you know, so eventually they did come and they literally like drilled some holes in the wall. And to be honest that did make a tiny bit of difference. That was like the only thing that really happened. And then another guy was like sort, um, was sent round, I guess an independent person was sent around to come and like, see. And he did say to me, basically, he was like, there is some stuff that could be done, but he won't do it cause it's expensive. But I think that those flats probably had those steps made and, I'm sure their rents were much higher. But yeah, I would say that… I'm just trying to remember, cause I know there was one other neighbour I spoke to who did have a big problem with it. She'd said that their stuff had all got wet and she was down, I think, in the sort of new build part of it, but the ground floor as well.

I'm not sure that I ever had much direct communication with the landlord. I think she must, cause she sort of told me a bit, cause she’d been there long, so she probably did have a relationship with him. So yeah, with the letting agents…                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Me    | Do you remember who the letting agents were?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Hilda | I can tell you.

And so when we were doing the lease for it, it’s like a business working lease. But it's had established use as a living space for 10 years. So, you know, there was a lot of this kind of thing where it was like, it's secure, but it's not legal, but it's not blah. And like, I was trying to work out what vulnerabilities you have when we signed the contract, and I guess, like who I was vulnerable to, whether that was the Council or the landlord, whether, you know, all these kinds of things. And so I think that through that, I've just become, I've like learned a lot more about things and I've got way more used to the idea of like, I dunno, that advocating for stuff. But I think, yeah, when I think at that point, I just felt like you were basically just at the mercy of having to kind of persuade your landlord to do something. And then, and then basically it was a choice of – I mean, I had thought with that place I was, you know, my initial feeling was like, when it sort of was starting, was that I would like to stay and I would ask if they would give us a rent reduction. So that maybe like we pay to have, you know – I guess I was still wondering whether there was something where we could do, like strip the paint, do a treatment, you know, there was something we could do ourselves if they would let us do that. But yeah I just realised that he was, he would just be able to get new people in for a higher rent. And wouldn't do that.

I mean, it was quite – I feel like this sort of humidity became apparent very quickly, just like the condensation on those massive windows. And that probably was just weird, to be honest, that kind of condensation and just like slightly dampness. But like the mould stuff. And then I feel like that went on – because also once mould's kind of coming, I don't even think that had fully gone away until it was blazing, hot, you know? And then went. Yeah, I think that really continued. Because I'm thinking even, even in the flat we lived in following from there, when I came back – cause during the first lockdown, I went to my parents – obviously, that was that super hot summer. And then I came back still in the summertime to our flat, I hadn't been there for, you know, three months or something. And obviously, yeah, it was a not-good condition. I guess if you locked a place up, it hasn't had any air in it for three months, but it was like summer-summer, and I came back and my stuff was just like, so wet and gross. I think that like, it felt like it took a while for it to begin, but that was just because your stuff comes in nice and dry. And then it just slowly gets wetter and like the mould things get into it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Me    | You mentioned that a new development went up close to where the windows in the bedrooms looked onto.

And so the thing that actually like totally blocked it was they put their like portacabin for the building works like against the back of our building. And actually the building works weren't finished even by the time we'd moved out. They were sort of finished shortly afterwards. And to be honest, that actually would've been a little bit better, I think, because I think that a bit of distance, like they would've been there and been big, but it was the kind of closeness of this cabin that meant there wasn't light.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Me    | And do you think that made a difference to the mould problem?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Hilda | No, I don't think so. It made a difference to the psychological feeling of it, but I would say no. I think the… In fact, what I was told – and again, maybe this was also a bit of a like, aesthetic judgement, I was like, oh, it's the exposed brick wall – but when the guy came into my room, he said that the main problem there was to do with the pipes. And that the pipes were like, I don't know, like not insulated. He just showed me that the pipes just had like liquid all over them, and they were running alongside my bed on the wall. And so, he was like, I think one of the things he was saying was like, oh, you know, just sort of putting insulation around and like boxing in these pipes would be a thing that would make a big difference. And that obviously wouldn't have, that was, I feel like quite localised to one room, so it definitely wasn't explaining the whole place, but I think those were the kinds of things that were like, I think just like probably anyone with a little bit of care to invest with some money into that, would've just done stuff like that, and it probably would've helped..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|       | REDACTED                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Me    | And do you think since that experience of living in that flat, has it made you more… Is it something that plays on your mind, when you're looking at other places to move into?

I think I'd had it in my mind as like, oh, everywhere has a little bit of damp. And so you can't freak out about there being a little bit of black round the windows and the place, because that's just like what living in – you know. So I think that had been my previous thing before was like, it wasn’t like a nice thing, and I definitely had lived in places where it was like, yeah, things got a little bit soggy. But this definitely was the first time where I was like – I felt like it really was just like affecting me mentally. And I think I could just see…  Yeah, just like, cause you had to constant – it was just so much more work of just like constantly checking that things weren't like, disintegrating or like being ruined all the time. So it was always like having to look around, and just like move things and change things and not use entire sections of your house. And then was really worried about Willa’s breathing and her health. So I think all of that stuff definitely psychologically was just like horrible and didn't stop and went on and on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then when it came again in the next flat that we were in and it was kind of lucky that the only room that wasn't affected was her bedroom. I think probably part of it is like having a child because it's just like, yeah, you feel so much more worried about what the implications of it are. Yeah, so then I guess it definitely made me just feel like this – you know, once you start, once you start getting upset by a thing, I feel like you get sensitive to it or something. So I became just really like, nah, I can't have this anymore. So, yeah. So I do feel really – this is definitely a thing that I'm quite anxious about moving. When you know, we're starting to look now, it's just feeling really like, worried about that feels really high risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Me    | And was kind of a plus about this place where you knew the people who'd been living here before?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Hilda | Literally. I asked so many people, I was like, it was a damp? And they were like, no, it's freezing. And I was like, I don't care about the cold. I mean, to be honest, I have cared a bit about the cold. There are lots of problems with this house, lots of problems and lots of things, you know, the roof leaks, it's freezing, it has mice, whatever. It's always filthy, but all these things, as much as they are not great, I would take all of these, even though I'm like dealing with them now, I would take all of those things other than mould. And yeah, and that was like nice to be able to make sure from people about that.

But it was just like, you know, sort of a bit cough-y. Just kind of had that like, generally seemed like she always had a bit of a cold type thing. And I probably did take her occasionally and it was like, oh, well, you know, she's a little kid. She goes to nursery. She gets unwell. So it was more like, in my mind, I was just like, I feel like she's just been ill for long, you know. I didn't worry about it initially, but after a while it was just like this has just been going on for a long time. And yeah, I mean, I really don't know if it's connected, but she has since been diagnosed with [asthma](cause-effect-affect/Asthma) and yeah. And that is definitely one of the things that they asked about, was like, does your house, does she live in a damp, mouldy house? And I was like no, no, not now, but around the time where it was kind of – where I began to be aware of her having, you know, wheezy breathing and stuff we did. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd yeah, there’s loads of things, that like… Yeah. You know, we also moved like, you know, the actual diagnosis and her bad asthma attack came when we moved here. And here definitely the pollution from the Old Kent Road is way worse than where we were in Camberwell. And like, you know, that could be another thing. And I was a bit like, oh, maybe if we move somewhere, that's away from like such a big road, it might be better. As you know, and so I don't know. It's hard to know whether it's a thing, but from my understanding, from what I've been told, it doesn't just come out of nowhere. It's not likely she moved here, and two weeks later and she got asthma. It's way more likely it's a thing that developed through weakening your lungs over a long period of time, which sounds more likely to be connected to that yeah. Or I could have just come anyway. Yeah. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I guess it's one of those things that like, when it's in your house, like it's like part of your everyday life. Like, you might not always say walk down Old Kent Road when it's at its most busy, or might not walk down it every day. Whereas like you are at home kind of every day, right? |\n| Me    | Yeah. And I think the things is just like… I mean, it's just such an obviously like environmentally connected condition. Like there's not much asthma in my family, but the only family unit that live in Londo – all the rest of my family do not live in London, they live in either towns or more like countryside area – but I think all of the ones that were born and grew up in London have asthma.

Yeah, no. Since she's basically got diagnosed and got her puffers and stuff, it's actually, yeah, it's been fine. It just took a long time. I think because she’s young, they’re quite reluctant? There was quite a long period where she wasn't diagnosed and she wasn't being medicated and it was really like, ahh. But yeah, no, it's been pretty great since, since she's puffing away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Me    | I wanted to ask, is there anything like else you wanna bring up or like stuff we haven't talked about that kind of feels relevant?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Hilda | Maybe part of it's like, cos you know, once you start thinking, you know, experiencing a thing just from also talking to – and maybe this is also part of the things that made me feel worried about it – but talking to like other mums at school who have had like, you know, similar, but like worse experiences, who like have not been able to leave basically. You know, maybe sort of similar, but have not been able to leave the flat and, you know, have had their children live for like years and years in a place where they've seen thing of like, you know, that kind of ongoing… \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA friend of mine's little girl is a sort of a slightly extreme version of what Willa was like, like she's just like, you know, even through the summer, she's just always like, seems borderline unwell. And even if it isn't caused by it, the like horrible, [psychological effect](cause-effect-affect/mental-health) that it has on the mum who thinks that… And it just feels like this really visualised thing. And also, you know, our place only ever had black mould, but her house has got all kinds of crazy colours. And, you know, it’s just… Yeah. These kinds of things that make you feel like your house is like not yours, not like a safe place or something. It's just like such a horrible, horrible feeling. And. Yeah. And so I guess the other thing of it, maybe, is that kind of feeling of like it's somehow like your responsibility or… Because I think that just often feels like the kind of first response. Because obviously there are things that you can do to control it. So I'm not saying it's completely unreasonable for people to be like, you know, how do you live in your house? Like, yeah, these are things that can be done. But I think that that quite often the implication of that stuff is just like, it's kinda like your fault. Which I think again, like added to those kinds of feelings of like…                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Me    | Yeah. I found something that I thought was quite shocking, from this guy who is an expert damp surveyor, and is called to be an expert witness in cases of damp – like a claim against a landlord or the Council. And he’d uploaded an example report of someone who had complained of a damp problem. And in the report, he’d put a picture of the house on Google Maps – it was like a block of three floors of flats – and he said from the picture, every other flat had their window open apart from this person. So he was like, it's their fault, they're not ventilating the house. Which I just thought was really shocking, for that to be ‘expert evidence.’ When like they could be, they could have been on holiday, they could have been at work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Hilda | Yeah, exactly. But also those are the kind of things I definitely feel like I get really sensitive to. It's like, you know, walking down and being like, oh, like that looks like a really nice building that I'd like to live somewhere like that. Because whatever, like it has nice communal outdoor space and then you're like, everyone has their windows open. I fucking know this is a horrible, like, this is a horribly damp building. I feel almost like that's also the thing, like yeah, sure, you can make a damp a bit better by having your windows, but then you're really cold. It's in the winter. Like they probably don't want to have the windows open. I would also feel less inclined to move into somewhere where the only way that you could live is to be really cold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Me    | And I feel like it's like a piece of advice that like is often given, right, that’s just gonna become more difficult with energy prices rising.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Hilda | Well, this is the thing.

And also, I guess, you know, we'd chosen to live, you know – we'd managed to find a place that was quite cheap. And so if [I had to then subsidise that by spending some more money on bills in order for it to](cause-effect-affect/finances), you know – that was a thing which was fine. But it will be really different if we end up living somewhere now where you have to run a dehumidifier and that is then becoming an extortionate energy cost. That's like, yeah, that's a really different thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Me    | And so you're moving in August, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Hilda | Between August and October. Depends on when we find somewhere. I think we'll be moving with Willa, my daughter and my friend Lucy who's here. So I am quite like excited to live in – my daughter says like ‘a normal flat.’ Somewhere with like a carpet and a radiator, and like a small space, you know? And I'm sure that lots of ways I'll suddenly be like, I miss it, but I do now have this desire for just like a snug place that I can keep clean. Be warm in, and things like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|       | REDACTED                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T08:07:36.331392424Z","tags":null},"/testimony/interview7":{"title":"Interview 07","content":"\nTranscript from an interview with [survey respondent](testimony/SR044), Priya.

Who you live here with, how long have you lived here? Sort of thing. But it’s kind of weird now cause I know that.

So we got upstairs neighbours, who like, whenever they get water on their floor, it like comes down to us.So like, I'm pretty sure all of this peeling wallpaper on the ceilings is from dampness on the ceilings. I'm pretty sure what that's, what that's from. And if you go in my bathroom, we've got like paint, peeling off the ceilings. And when it's really bad, the ceilings are like brown from dampness. And in the hallway it’s like that as well. But, uh, that's like, if you look up.

Like it was built in a way that means we get damp. Um, and that the most we can do is like constantly wipe down the walls, keep the windows open so that there's good ventilation in the house.

Basically. It depends. There's lots of different things that can cause damp.The two main things that cause damp in London are like condensation or, or penetrating damp. So condensation would be caused by like lack of ventilation.

Like we called the Council about, uh, damp on our ceiling in the hallway. Um, and basically told them like, oh, there's a leak, it's coming for our ceiling. We even made it sound worse. Cos like that's generally what you do with getting council repair. Uh, we were like, yeah, the ceiling's like crumbling, blah, blah, blah. And they were like, cool. Our earliest appointment is in October and my dad was like, so what do we do if the ceiling crumbles in that time? They're like, then you just call again.

Yeah. Like I think that obviously councils seem to be overwhelmed, underfunded, blah, blah, blah, blah. But ultimately like you shouldn't be allowed to provide housing that is subpar. Like if, if you were a private landlord, it would be unacceptable to provide a house. I mean, it wouldn't actually. But you would think that it's unacceptable and that you could take someone to court for providing you unsafe housing and damp falls under whats unsafe housing. So it is kind of mad that like the council deals with some of the most vulnerable, like broke people in society. And it's just like, yeah, you can just live with dampness. And like, you can spend your whole life being paranoid about dampness and like scrubbing down balls and, uh, keeping your windows open in the winter to deal with it.

Do you feel like it’s that they’re overwhelmed, or does it make you feel like they don’t really care?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Priya | I think it's a combination of both. Uh, I think they're probably overwhelmed, but I think also things like this they've become so used to just fobbing people off, it doesn't seem like as big an issue as it should be. Uh, because as you see, like with, when Kwajo gets involved. Suddenly councils, housing associations, suddenly, they have the resources to care. Uh, but I think that's only because they're being threatened with a long time, not a good time. Um, but yeah, I think it's a combination of both. I think it's lack of resources means that they've chosen not to allocate time and resources to resolving this issue. But if you really, really press them as Kwajo does, uh, then you can finally see some sort of result. Something like that, something like that. I mean, I don't really have any understanding of like the inner workings of the Council.                                                                    |\n| Me    | I feel like I've kind of covered everything, but this is has been shorter than some of my interviews.

I live with my boyfriend who is not here clearly, at the minute. We lived in Shadwell, like just down the road before with flatmates and it was a shithole. It wasn't. But it was shit. So we were like, we're gonna move, found this and thought it was great. It is great – in summer, but it's also damp.  So it's like dual aspect. So obviously like this is south facing here, but that side is totally north facing. Yeah. So it gets like next to no sunlight, which we just didn't think about when we said yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Me       | And do you find that like it's on those walls?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Jessica  | Yeah.

We've got concierges, they're great. We've got one maintenance guy that they really overwork. So for that side and this side, everything.We have cleaners who do all the communal areas and stuff. The actual maintenance is really, really bad. And it's so bad that the leaseholders are trying to get a percentage to do right to manage. Which is, yeah, I can't remember. I think they have to reach 50% and I think they're nearly there and then they can ballot to get the right to manage the block so they would choose the contractors that come in and do maintenance. They'd have more say over what maintenance has done and what their lease charges go towards. And that's because the quality of the maintenance has gone down so much. You can tell, even since we moved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Me       | And is there a company at the moment that kind of manages the like maintenance concierge sort of thing?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Jessica  | I think it's all in house. Like it's this whole block, then this whole development is called the Aldgate Triangle and there's definitely some stuff online about it. Like, okay. I think it was built in 2000. So these were about 22 years old, roughly 20. Which means they're kind of too young to be having this much of a damp issue, you would've thought.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Me       | Yeah. It's funny, because you always see stuff where, especially in social housing, someone will be like well it's because it's so old.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Jessica  | Yeah. And. It's not even that old. It's not even that old. Like, social housing is built so much better as well than these flats are.

Do you know when that started or do you remember when it kind of of shifted?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Jessica  | I'm just trying to think. Not necessarily just with the damp and stuff, but like, there's definitely less cleaners than there were pre COVID. We have a rooftop, like across the road, so that building has a rooftop that we are allowed access to. And that used to have like five tables, loads of chairs, all of that stuff. There is now one table. And I was like to the concierge, hey, so where have the tables gone? And he was. I dunno. I think they've replaced a couple now, but just, how do you get rid of four tables in the course of a few weeks? What is happening?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Me       | Were they big tables?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Jessica  | They were huge. But yeah, it’s definitely gone down hill. I think – I wouldn't say it's completely related to the pandemic, but in the last, like two and a half years, I've definitely noticed just like the quality of maintenance has gone down quite a lot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Me       | I was gonna ask maybe if it was related to the pandemic, but I guess it's hard to know if it's like, did it just happen around the same time as the pandemic or is it related?

I don't think there hasn't been a lot of transience, like resident transience, since I've lived here, there's been a few moving in and out, but they've all been private rental as far as I know. So you're not getting leasehold charges from them anyway. But yeah, so it's definitely gone downhill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Me       | So if it's a private rental, would the landlord still pay the leasehold charge?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Jessica  | Yes. But I think they have to do that even if the flat's vacant. So I think it's just the same. So I honestly don't know, I'm like who's creamy some money off the top.

A hundred percent. So it's such a nice flat in summer. It's really lovely. Like, yeah. South facing, you've got these big windows. I think the temperature in here is quite nice. Um, Even the bedroom's like fine in summer. In winter, like between about November and March, the bedroom is so damp. All of the clothes that we have… Because obviously this flat has three completely external walls, which means that heat does not stay in anyway. But the wall at the back where we have clothes against, my boyfriend has a chest of drawers next to that wall – our clothes – Like we go to get clothes out and they are smelly. Like [they smell of damp](evidence/smell). They are moist. We haven't had anything like bringing out a piece of mouldy clothing yet, but it's like, oh, I want to wear that jumper. Oh, that jumper's got to go straight in the wash. And it's freezing. It's freezing in here in winter. In this bit as well in this bit as well. And because of the damp issues, the cold air is wet. So I'm just like, I'm not doing another winter here. They're also upped the rent by 255 pounds. It’s a lot. So even if we hadn't decided to move that would've forced us out anyway, cause we can't afford that, but we were already like, we are not doing another winter here. Clothes takes six days to dry.

It's the worst. So I want to leave on a high, cause it is so nice to be in summer. But like if I have a bath in winter, cos there's so much like, like the bathroom window doesn't close, so much air gets in. I can have a bath for like 15 minutes and then I'm so cold. I have to get out. It's really bad.

So on that it goes up, that is obviously an external wall. So it doesn't stay in this one. Also that one, you get like little flickers of electricity coming off it, so I don't wanna turn it on. Cause I think it's a fire hazard. Yeah. This one, the heat goes out to about here and… So like, what's the point. So we had to buy a portable radiator. We've had to buy an electric blanket, like all of that stuff. Cause it's just so cold. Like in winter it's really bad. And the only radiator in the bathroom is a heated towel rack.

And it's like, is it though? They also clearly know that there is a slight problem because when we moved in, in the moving instructions for the bathroom, it was like, you must keep the heated towel rack on at all times. They were like, you must keep the heated tower rack on at all times. You must keep the extractor fan on – when you turn the light on and the extractor fan runs, they were like, you have to keep that on as much as possible. I'm like, have you heard of an electricity bill? Like, no, I'm not doing that, but you wouldn't have those instructions in there if you didn't know that there was a humidity problem and a damp problem.

We probably spend about four quid most days at the minute on, and that's in summer without radiators. It's not good.

We are the top floor. I think one of the issues – I think the issue that's causing this in the corner of the living room with the paint peeling off the ceiling is the fact it's a flat roof. Like, I don't know if you're allowed to build with these roofs anymore. I'm pretty sure you're not because of the way that water collects on the roof. And it can be a really big flood hazard if there's lots of rain and stuff. Cos that started coming up in winter when it was really, really wet. So I wonder if that's caused a bit of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat big building over there – I feel like wouldn't have as many problems cos it's got the insulation of having people around every side. But if you walk onto Commercial Road, when you walk out and look up, you will see a massive damp stain up one of the external brick walls of that building on the front facade of that. Which I think is interesting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|          | REDACTED                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Me       | So you've lived here for four years.

It was great. Our old flat really was pretty horrible. So I think we were just so happy to be in here. And then by November it was like, we were noticing the clothes were taking longer and longer to dry. I think that was one of the first things we noticed. Like we normally do washing at the weekend. And by the Friday of the following week, it still wouldn't be completely dry to put away. And then it got really cold that winter and I weighed a lot less than I do now. So I was really cold all the time. And like, I have really bad circulation in my hands. And I remember. I wasn't working from home then, so like that helped, but like the odd occasion I would – I'd just sit here and like, not be able to feel my fingers. We'd be going to bed and [I'd be too cold to go to sleep](evidence/temperature). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that room is what, like, again, the air and it was so wet, so that didn't really help. And at that time – my boyfriend does a PhD and I was on way less of a salary than I get now – so we didn't wanna run a heater all night. Like we couldn't run a heater all night. And we were like, shit, have we made a really big mistake. And then, like you said, it goes to March and you're like, it's lovely. And then you forget about it. You know how I said to my friend the other day, you know, how like women give birth and then forget about the pain. So you do it again. It's like that, but with a flat and maybe less extreme, but yeah, we forgot about it. And then the next winter was the same. And we did complain to the landlords and they were like, make sure you're ventilating the rooms… thanks!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Me       | Is that the only thing your landlord has said in the like four years?

Like the painting on the window sills, like the wood paint in the bathroom and the bedroom is incredibly cracked. We sort of raised the concern about the damp in the bedroom, particularly. And they would just like, make sure that you're keeping everything ventilated, keep the heaters on. And like within our financial capacity to do that, we absolutely were like… There is just something about the way that landlords talk to you. Like you're an idiot and it's like, I have the common sense to ventilate the room and put the heater on in the evenings. But like we did that. We have damp traps, like everywhere. We had damp traps in the wardrobe at one point. And they sent out a maintenance man, that also happened to be their son, to have a look at it. And he came back and he said, oh, the only thing he said is when you move out, you are not liable for the damage to the paint. They are now trying to say that we're liable for the damage to the pain. I think they might have given up now cos I went back with some strongly worded citizens advice stuff, uh, because tenants are never liable to that kind of weathering.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut yeah, we've raised it before. We've had so many issues in this property and they're really unresponsive in terms of how willing they are to actually deal with them. Like they do respond, but it's never to say anything substantive that will actually help. So yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Me       | And you mentioned like your hands getting so cold you couldn't like feel them.

I don't think allergies. There was one year when I did get like a cold every other week, it seemed like, but I was also super stressed. Yeah. So I don't know if it was just that. But I got like – my hands were so dry, like it would bleed like in between here. I think the worst winter was the first winter of COVID, cos we were in all the time, obviously. I think that was a colder winter than last winter was. So yeah, I would sit here, this would all be like bleeding. like this would all be scaly. And I started getting this like, cracking, like all up here that was kind of eczema-y and I've never had eczema or anything. So that was pretty like, ugh. And like hand cream didn't help. Oh and all here as well. Like, I'd get all these little paper cut looking things here. And it was just like, urgh. He doesn't feel the cold as badly as I do, so he was kind of okay. Men! So he was kind of okay, but I really struggled. He got shingles for a while actually, and I think the cold really did not help how gross he felt like during that. But we didn't get any like respiratory, or anything like that. I have a friend who lived in a flat in Layton that was so mouldy that she got bronchitis. Which is just horrendous, but no, nothing, nothing that bad for us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Me       | Yeah. I always feel like I ask most people this, but it's always such a weird question to ask because it's so hard to pinpoint. Especially with like the types of health things that I think damp is often linked to, it’s all stuff that is so nonspecific.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Jessica  | Yeah. And like a doctor will never say like, this is because of your housing, which they should sort of thing. I guess that is the interesting thing about this flat as well. Cause when I think about like damp, and of people who live in places that have damp and stuff, you think about health, inequalities and comorbidities and like demographics of people that normally have to deal with that kind of shit housing, right? And I think that's what makes me so cross with this is that it's quite a nice flat that we pay an absolute fortune for, and it isn't the normal demographic. I'm not saying that I should have damp less than other people. I'm saying it's just such a unique and weird situation to be in, in a flat that looks like it should be so nice and is so hell for like half of the year. But like all of my family living council housing, and none of them have anything like this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Me       | And are your family from London?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Jessica  | Yeah. I'm from like, Hounslow? I'm from Hounslow. And we all live in council housing out there, and I've never seen anything like this in any of the houses that we've lived in – we've lived in loads – or like my family have lived in and then you come to this and they market it as like a sort of exclusive opportunity. Like it's so cold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Me       | I see so many stories, from flats that are much newer than this, like built in the last three years, someone who's paying four grand to live ‘luxury exclusive lifestyle accommodation.’ And it's like, the lift floods every day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Jessica  | Oh my god. I mean, I don't believe that there should be anything like elite or exclusive accommodation anyway, like everyone just deserves to have a good home. But like, if you are making someone pay a grand and a half a month, it probably shouldn’t be damp. Like, I dunno, it shouldn't be damp for anyone, but I just think the lack of accountability when it's a private landlord is just so much worse than when it's a bigger housing association.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Me       | And talking about accountability, did you ever at any point think of contacting anyone other than your landlord?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Jessica  | Yeah. I'm a member of [London Renters Union](resistance/renters-unions), and I was really, really considering it cause we had that, and at the same time as we had the damp last year, the cold water tap in our bathroom sink stopped working and it didn't get fixed for 11 weeks. So I was just washing my face over the bath for 11 weeks, which is obviously an absolute first world problem, but it's still annoying and shouldn't be the case. So I was so close to contacting London Renters Union, but I was so scared of getting Section 21-ed that I decided not to. But obviously the renters reform stuff should assist with that in future. So I didn't, but I did think about it. And with Tower Hamlets Council. I dunno. I was just like, they've got a housing waiting list of 20,000 people to deal with, are they really gonna come and like, look at my damp. And my landlords live in Essex. So I was like, they're not exactly close by to – I dunno. And they're really old. They're like in their seventies.

The implication was definitely, but like we've done something wrong and it's like, no housing depreciates over time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Me       | And were you the first people they've rented at two since moving out?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Jessica  | No. No, I think they lived here, yeah, like 10 years ago. It was a couple before us and the women got pregnant, so they had to move somewhere bigger.

Like have I been a bad tenant when you're pretty sure you haven't and like, we've always raised it as soon as, um, like stuff has come up, but…                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Me       | And as you're like the top floor, there anything that the management people do in terms of like clearing the gutters?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Jessica  | No, not that I've ever seen.No. No, because we get people like coming to clean the windows and stuff and you see them sort of abs sailing past, like, hi. So I feel like I would've seen if people were vibing up on the roof, but, I've never seen that to my knowledge. No, which is probably quite bad, now you've said it. I dunno what’s up there. There's like a hatch just outside and I've been really tempted before to just be like, but I dunno what's up there. It's probably like a load of moss because I don't think they've cleared the gutters. I’m just going to grab some water.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|          | REDACTED                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Me       | And yeah, we were talking about physical health, but how would you say it's impacted your mental health, or affected you emotionally?

But it does impact him too. Like it's [his clothes that get the brunt of it in winter](cause-effect-affect/damage-to-belongings). So I think he finds that tiring. I just don't want to be here in winter. I think it was especially hard over COVID because we either have to have the heating on, or three sets of heating on, and you'd still be in like three layers and you'd feel like the Michelin man trying to work. And it was just awful. It was just really crap to be in. And when you couldn't escape it as well to like go to the office or to like go and work somewhere else, I think that felt incredibly suffocating. Just, you couldn't even…  Oh, what was really bad actually is when we were both wanting to be on calls that the bedroom was so cold, neither of us wanted to go and sit in there for like the duration of a one hour call. Cos you would just be freezing or like you would get out the shower – between like November and February – you get out the shower, your teeth are chattering. Like you go into the bedroom, it doesn't warm you up. Like you are shaking, getting into bed. That is tiring, just emotionally exhausting. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I think some of that is, yeah, I'm just quite a cold person, but that's not the point, is it? Like, my boyfriend would always be like, is it really quite that cold? And I'm like, yes, it’s freezing. And just things like, oh, if you wanna leave your hair to dry, it will take seven hours, like rather than one or two in summer. So you just don't have choice. You don't have choice.

Definitely, definitely, definitely. Like, it wouldn't feel like a cosy space to be in, in winter. I'd like, be like, I'd rather go down the pub – cause at least it's warm in the pub – than sit here. And if you sat here and you came in, like, I felt like I had to sort of gear myself up for it. Cause I was like, cool, five hours of being cold before I can go to bed. And five hours of feeling damp. I know I keep talking about cold rather than damp, but I think a dry cold is so different to that like, wet cold that you really got just from being in here. So we'd have to like stuff stuff under the door here to stop the damp from that side of the house coming in, which was beautiful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Me       | Maybe this sounds weirdly specific, but it’s something a lot of people I’ve spoken to have brought up.

I definitely think it's like a running joke with my friends that I would always rather go to someone else's house anyway. So I don't think it impacted me that much, but I think Jack, my partner, like he really likes entertaining and yeah, in winter he definitely didn't really, because it was just like, I'm gonna invite people here to be uncomfortable. But yeah, for me, not tonnes. But it did make me want to go out more. So I would be like, hello, can I come to your house? Cos it was a warm house to be in in the evenings. Also made me want to go home to my mum’s house a lot more than I otherwise would've done. So I think I spent more time there than in the flat I was paying rent for. During winter I definitely went for longer over Christmas and stuff, cos I knew it would be warm, than stay in here. Cause like January's bloody cold, isn't it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Me       | I have one more question.

Yeah. I think there's like tons of issues. I think one is accountability, right? Because I think the level of damp we have probably contravenes the Decent Homes Standard, I would imagine. And I don't think the accountability for private landlords to have to like retrofit stuff to alleviate that is anywhere near strong enough. I think once we had complained about it, they should have had to, I dunno, insulate. I know there's a program going on about retrofitting social and housing association homes. I think that should be extended to the private rented sector, like with immediate effect. I think the lines of communication between landlords and estate agents and tenants need to be mandated to be a lot stronger, because we would just email about stuff and they would just ignore it and ignore it. And they have every right to do that. Like, we can't do anything as tenants when they do that. So we were just stuck waiting for like repairs or answers to questions or whatever. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe probably should have asked for a [dehumidifier](cause-effect-affect/dehumidifier) to be honest, but like, there's not really anywhere to put it in this flat and they're expensive to run. So I wonder if there's also something about like, whether landlords should take on the costs of like mitigating that kind of action to alleviate like damp and cold and stuff in the house. I also think that they should have been mandated to change the radiators. These are clearly not fit for purpose. Yeah. And I think at the heart of it, I mean, obviously this is gonna change, I think just scrapping, like Section 8 and Section 21, because we didn't feel like we were empowered to complain about some of this stuff. And the market is so stuffed, that we were like, if we complain and we get checked out, where else are we gonna find that is this nice for eight, nine months of the year that we can still afford? So I just think like genuinely empowering tenants to be able to raise things without fear of like no fault [eviction](cause-effect-affect/displacement) – no brainer, right?

Let’s go see some damp. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe're pretty sure that was caused by damp, I thought it was actual cracks for a while, cos I was too scared to go and touch. And we also realised that these bits of paper have been falling into that lamp, which is obviously a fire hazard. Which is great. Oh, I think I can see one here. Yeah. There's a bit of paper under here. That's just our ceiling coming off. So that's definitely damp.We're getting a bit of cracking on these window seals like a little bit from winter. Like, can you see that there? Like, but they're not too bad. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the worst. So yeah, like, sorry it's a bit messy, like Jack's stuff is all up against that wall. Mine are all in there. This is three months worth, in summer as here. Can you see all this crack in there? Look at the mould on the back of there as well. So that's like completely cracked. We can't really open this that wide quite a lot of the time, cos that's actually a church and there's always people outside being really loud.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|          | REDACTED                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Jessica  | Look at all that these flakes, you just touch it and it flakes, all up the sides as well in winter, this becomes covered in mould. And I have to just wipe it off, like as soon as I notice it every day. Which is really great. I feel worse for Jack. Cause like he sleeps on this side, his stuff is here and it's just like mould in winter. My clothes are in that side of the wardrobes cos it's bigger, and all the ones that are lining up at the top corner, especially, which makes me think there's something to do with the roof, like all my jumpers that are on this side, they smell, they will, they will smell that if I get them down now, and there's just nothing I can do. And it makes me feel gross. Just that that's happening to my stuff. And we've just got a tiny little radiator behind there as well. That's for the whole room for the whole room. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat doesn't close. They have said twice that they will come and repaint this. They haven't. It's gross. Like, I don't know why this doesn't close. I don't know if it's like an expansion thing, cos there's so much water in the wood. But like some of our stuff that we have here, like in winter gets kind of coated, with like a weird, like humid – you even see a bit like here. But there's nowhere else to put it because there's no storage in this flat. But it's freezing. And it’s a bit mouldy up there as well. It gets really mouldy here in winter. And obviously, cos this doesn't close, you'll see what I mean about the shower, like the air just gets in here and you're freezing by the time you've had a bath. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat's kind of it. We've also had like three heating replacements, like heated water replacements since we've come in, cos the plumbing’s been an absolute mess as well. Oh, yeah, there's some cracky over there as well. Oh, a bit of mould that I haven't noticed, fantastic. But it's very much in the corners. So I think it is something to do with the fact that we're top floor. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd it just makes me really cross. Like that is just gross and just, I find it quite [embarrassing](cause-effect-affect/Shame). Like when people come round, like it's bits of our ceiling hanging off, do you know what I mean? There's nothing we can really do. And also someone that really – I think if it's someone else's responsibility, I'm someone that very much is like, that is your responsibility you sort it. You know, some people, oh, that's okay, I'll fix it. I'm like, no. Like, no, this is your job. You do it. |\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-04T08:07:36.331392424Z","tags":null},"/testimony/interview9":{"title":"Interview 09","content":"\nTranscript from interview with [survey respondent](testimony/SR059), Irati.

I think what happened was that there was like a section of the bedroom that we never looked inside. It’s basically like, if there's there's a window in the bedroom and if you kind of like properly put your head into the window frame and you can see that, like there's a lot of damp, but because that was an area we didn't really look at, or didn't really clean, I think, when we were first in the flat, we didn't really notice. But that's the first time me or Mond like picked up on the fact that there was like a damp issue, cause it was like sort of this area was like speckled with black dots. And then I think it also started happening along that same wall. And then it was like very, very obvious just to the naked eye, but that was like a few months into living here for sure. So no, we hadn't heard about the damp issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Me    | And you're talking about the bedroom, is it mainly confined to the bedroom or do you feel like it's in other rooms as well?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Irati | It is just the bedroom.

So we moved in in the summer and it was quite hot and we didn't really notice the damp. So that also probably makes sense that it started sort of appearing when the weather was getting colder or when it was a bit rain-y-er. But it has always been confined to the window. And again, it's sort of like that window area, and then just the wall next to that window. It hasn't – oh, and a little bit of that roof as well, but it's very much like that corner. And it hasn't really spread beyond that, but also we're like quiet on top of cleaning it. Well Mond does, I've never cleaned that area before, but he's quite on top of like cleaning it, like bleaching it. And so we sort of never let it get out of control and I don't even know how far it would spread if we did. But it definitely does have to do with the window, cause that window gets really, really wet. In the winter when it's rained there's like a small sort of pool of water that kind of like puddles, right where the window is when it's rained. So I think that's just like quite a damp area in general. It's like the windows. And then also that the bathroom upstairs. There's just like a lot going on, which means that that area gets quite damp and gross.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Me    | When you say like there's water pooling, is that inside or outside?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Irati | Inside. So if you're like at the window, you're in the bedroom, you look at the window, the window's in front of you and there's just like, kind of like a small line of water, that's there sort of like after it's rained, I think. So water does definitely find a way to get in. Or I don't know if that's like the condensation more than the rain, which I suppose that it is. Um, but then yeah, I think that like the stuff with the wall and the roof, that's more the upstairs bathroom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Me    | And you talked about Mond cleaning it a lot.

And he's quite obsessive now about the inside of the window. So like, he'll always poke his head in and like have a look and be like, oh, the window, like it's getting bad. And then do the cleaning. Whereas like, I don't really bother to look if like, if I do see it spread across the wall. That would be quite gross and like, I would take it upon myself to clean it, but I think that he's just much quicker to react.

I think – so we had a separate issue. I think we had an issue with the washing machine or like maybe the boiler, but someone came round and before they came around, we were also – cause we had raised this like damp and mould issue before and they hadn't done anything, but they were coming around for a separate issue, which was a bit more urgent. Again, it was someone from Roy Brook. So it wasn't the landlady. And like during that visit, they asked, like, are you having any other issues? And we were like, yes. So we've raised this thing about like the sort of damp mould situation in the bedroom. And so I think that the guy that came around was familiar with the flat, cause he was like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I know what you mean. And then he suggested just like leaving the window open and using a [dehumidifier](cause-effect-affect/dehumidifier), but was like, there's nothing more we can really do for you. And since that visit, which was like, yeah, last winter, we were using the dehumidifier every single day during the winter, which was [really expensive](cause-effect-affect/finances) and trying to open the window as much as possible. So yes, it has been raised and those were the solutions proposed that we've implemented.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Me    | And with the dehumidifier.

So the flat came almost completely unfurnished, but there was a dehumidifier sort of in the storage space that we have, which suggests that again, like this would've been an ongoing issue cause like the previous people would've used it. I don't know if it was like previous tenants who left it or if it actually belongs to the agency or to the landlady, but we didn't really ask. We just have started using it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Me    | And you mentioned the cost of running the dehumidifier. Do you find you think you spend more on say heating the house warmer as well to keep it dry? Or is that something that you don't really think about with it being so confined to one area?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Irati | Yeah, I think we don't have the heater on, in the bedroom just because in the winter we don't really spend much time in there. So it's just the dehumidifier that we have on, we haven't considered, doing more heating. We do actually have it for a few hours in the evening, but that's sort of independent from the damp issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Me    | And have you or Mond ever lived somewhere else with a damp problem or is this the first time you've moved somewhere and found something like this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Irati | I don't know about Mond. Though, I do recall there like slightly being a damp issue at the previous flat in Brixton as well, but it definitely wasn't as bad as here. I just have this memory of again, in the previous flat, like Mond cleaning again with like bleach and a rag, cause he was like, oh, like the damp, the damp is back. But it definitely wasn’t that bad, because it's not that memorable. We didn't have a dehumidifier and it wasn't like ever raised like with the landlord or anything. So I think there was probably a slight issue, but not as bad as here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Me    | And say, it kind of seems obvious that they knew there was a problem before – how does that make you feel about your relationship and your dealings with your landlord or with Roy Brooks?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Irati | I think like, I don't care too much about Roy Brooks because I sort of went into this knowing that they would be quite shit. Like, that they wouldn't be very helpful because that's like most people have had quite distant or frustrating relationships when they're flat is owned by an agency, such as Rob Brooks. I think I haven't thought about this too much. And I think because I'm not the person in the household, who's like taken that, you know, mental charge to deal with it, I think that I just have the privilege to knowing that it's to know that it's an issue and not doing that much about it. Like Mond would definitely be the better person to interview, perhaps if he'd filled out your survey, which I don't think he did. I think that it hasn't bothered me as much, but it definitely bothers Mond more because he does more about the issue. And I have heard him complain. And I know that when that Roy Brooks guy did come round, he was like, that's really annoying advice that they just told us to run the diffuser, like all day, every day, because it's so expensive, and he's told us to just like have the window open in the winter at night and like basically freeze to death. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I know that Mond was quite annoyed with that response. I don't feel a massive sense of like betrayal or like we've really been let down cause I think, yeah, again, like I had quite low expectations. People tend to have like issues with landlords, with agencies and stuff. And because it’s like, I would say like, the only real issue that we've experienced in the flat I'm yeah. Not too upset or disappointed by it. If it was like, a combination of issues that had really culminated I'd probably feel differently, but this is one thing it is quite contained. I mean, it is, it is a problem. And I do wish that we'd known in advance because we would've maybe factored in like the extra cost of running the dehumidifier, but I'm kind of like, well shrug about it. And yeah, as I said, perhaps Mond feels a little bit more strongly than I do. |\n| Me    | And so you've had one winter in the flat.

When you say no, for sure. For sure. Cause in the summer it's a lot easier to keep the window open. It's been raining less. We haven't been running the dehumidifier when it's warm at all. Um, and I think that like, yeah, the damp issue has like been a little bit improved for sure. But like our bills have soared, you know, much like everyone else’s. And I am like, I am just thinking about having to run the dehumidifier literally all day and just like, ugh, that is really annoying. And like the amount of humidity in the room is really quite high. Like when we first, switch it on, I forget the exact number, but it's like a very high percentage in the room. And then when it's been like running for a few hours like that, that percentage drops by sort of 10, 20%. So it definitely does do something.

But it has certainly caused frustration, especially when we first learned about the issue, we had to get the dehumidifier out. We were like, oh, this is actually quite shit. We were like, I don't know if we were like, actually worried about the cost, because it isn't something that like, couldn't be covered. But it was just like, it was frustrating. It was annoying.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I think that, like, there is an element psychologically. When it did get quite damp and the wall was quite like black and speccy, you just feel like you're in an unsafe environment and it's quite gross and it's bad for your health. So even though I don't think it has affected my physical health per se, when I have seen that bit of the window or like the damp start to like show on the walls, it does sort of disgust me and it makes me think, oh, my goodness. I'm like living in this, I'm sleeping in this room that's like full of black mould and like, you know, kind of catastrophize a little bit. I wouldn't say that it's been like a huge mental health impact, but like it, it has been an inconvenience and of course, like I'd much rather have not had to deal with this issue in any way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Me    | So is it something that has made you want to move out of the house or is it like – you say there's not been any other problems – do you feel like, well, if we move somewhere else, they'd probably have some other problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Irati | Yeah. Yeah. That's exactly how I feel. It is annoying, but it wouldn't be a driver to go somewhere else because I know that other things would come up in a different flat, perhaps worse. And like when you're first renting somewhere, you're not gonna be told straight up what all of these issues are. Like, we definitely discovered some issues in our previous flat as well. So no, it wouldn't, it wouldn't drive us to move out.

Like, what's it like and whatever season that we're not. So I would definitely ask about damp. If it was like in the summer, I'd be like, how, does it get very damp in the winter?

Again, like maybe this is just like me being a bit of a pessimist, but I guess, I wasn't surprised, but it would've been great to be able to factor in the extra cost of running a dehumidifier, knowing that like before signing a contract, because it means that what you're paying monthly in rent, that's not an accurate cost. I don't know if this was, if we explicitly requested this, but I remember having a conversation with Mond about like actually the extra cost of running the dehumidifier. Like, we shouldn't be the ones to cover that because we were never told about the issue and it wasn't apparent when we came for the viewing or anything. So I think that those are like small, practical steps that could be taken. But again, like, I'm not surprised about the lack of transparency. Cause I feel like things are always going to come up like this. But it would be, it would be better if people could be more upfront about these things.
