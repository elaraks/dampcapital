title: "Gentrification"

Gentrification is the process whereby the character of a poor urban area is changed by wealthier people moving in, often displacing current inhabitants in the process. Though not always the case, in London this is increasingly driven by [urban regeneration schemes](cause-effect-affect/regeneration) (in which the state may act as a agent for this gentrification), and property speculation.
