## Asthma

Of many health conditions, asthma is often considered to have the strongest proven link to damp housing. As for other types of [atopic disease](cause-effect-affect/Atopy), common triggers thrive in damp conditions, conditions which alone already have a worsening effect on respiratory health. <a href="https://oem.bmj.com/content/70/5/325" target="_blank">Research has shown</a> that up to 15% of adult onset asthma could be attributed directly to exposure to dampness at home.

Asthma is an inflammatory disease of the lungs' airways, characterised by wheezing, a tightening of the chest, and the feeling of not being able to breath well enough. Less than 100 years ago, it was thought of as a psychosomatic illness; it's treatment talking cures. Today, while its aetiology continues to elude, it is managed through a variety of medications, and lifestyle modifications. Within the latter category, the avoidance of triggers is considered to be one of the most important components of improving symptoms and preventing life-threatening attacks. But what do you do when such triggers are embedded your everyday life? When you wake up with them each morning and go to sleep with them at night?

## Other respiratory problems

While asthma is undoubtable a key focal point, other chronic respiratory problems, such as COPD and emphysema are significantly worsened by living in damp housing.

## National context

The UK has some of the worst asthma outcomes in Europe, and some of the highest of illness in the world. As noted by the [UK Centre for Moisture in Buildings](cause-effect-affect/health-and-moisture), there is evidence this high case rate is directly linked to the moisture condition in buildings. Deaths from asthma have also increased: <a href="https://www.asthma.org.uk/about/media/news/press-release-asthma-death-toll-in-england-and-wales-is-the-highest-this-decade/" target="_blank">between 2008 and 2018</a>, they had risen by 33%. More broadly death rate from lung conditions[^1] in the UK are the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/HLTH_CD_ASDR2__custom_2053067/default/table?lang=en" target="_blank">second highest in Europe</a>, following Turkey.

## Class, housing, and breath(lessness)

There are <a href="https://www.asthma.org.uk/58a0ecb9/globalassets/campaigns/publications/The-Great-Asthma-Divide.pdf" target="_blank">stark socioeconomic disparities</a> in asthma outcomes within the UK. Those in household with the lowest incomes are more significantly more likely to have uncontrolled asthma, to have in the past year: had more than two asthma attacks, been prescribed more than two courses of oral steroids, and used emergency care. Significantly, the same report revealed that those with asthma in London were the least likely to be receiving basic management care.

While income is often the focus of such measures, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/25/low-pay-and-damp-housing-driving-uk-lung-disease-deaths-study-finds" target="_blank">recent research</a> has found that damp housing is a core factor driving such disparities.

It excludes, among others, lung cancers, smoke inhalation, congenital malformations, injury, and certain infectious diseases (notably tuberculosis).
