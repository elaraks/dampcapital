Shame and embarrassment are common side effects of enduring dampness. This predominantly manifests in relation to inviting friends and family over,   

While survey respondents from all tenure types reported such feelings in relation to their living conditions, levels of this were markedly higher in the social rented sector. In addition to this, although respondents and interviewees in the [PRS](providers/PRS) did report similar *feelings*, they were less likely to report it limiting their activities. For example, while a respondent in the PRS might say it made them feel embarressed when guests were visiting, a corresponding response from a social tenant would more likely describe actively not inviting guests over at all.

This compounding of shame for social tenants is in part linked to [stigma](cause-effect-affect/stigma), which surrounds both the poor conditions in social housing, and social housing more broadly as a tenure.

In some cases, shame and embarrassment can also become affectual causes for the worsening and prolonging of damp conditions. For instance, it may lead someone to delay reporting their conditions for fear that it might lead to judgement, or that they are ultimately at fault.
