Those who endure damp conditions face heightened financial costs, undertaken in order to mitigate the problem and its effects.

These are wide-ranging, and can be direct or indirect, long-term, or occasional. A direct and occasional financial impact might be the need to buy specialist paint to treat a damp or mouldy wall, or replacing damaged belongings. A direct long-term financial impact might be increased energy costs due to the need to run a [dehumidifier](cause-effect-affect/dehumidifier), or heat the property to a higher degree (for instance, to mitigate warmth lost through leaving windows open in winter). A indirect financial impact might be wages lost due to sickness, either from a long term or an acute health problem likely exacerbated or caused by someone's living conditions.

The financial burden of living with dampness are often cited as a key 'worry,' highlighting the accretive [mental health](cause-effect-affect/mental-health) implications this can have.

Relevant also is the growing numbers experiencing [fuel poverty](cause-effect-affect/fuel-poverty).
