Barnsbury estate, in [Islington](providers/islington), is managed by Newlon Housing Association. Currently 371 homes are under threat in its approved [regeneration](cause-effect-affect/regeneration) plan.

In March 2021, a residents ballot was held in which 73% of those who voted supported the proposals on a 79% turnout. Newlon’s formal Landlord Offer made it clear that if residents voted against redevelopment then it wouldn’t tackle the ongoing symptoms of the estate’s neglect.
