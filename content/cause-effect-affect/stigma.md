### Territorial stigmatisation

Territorial stigmatisation is a concept developed by Loïc Wacquant in the early 1990s. It aims to link  subjective experiences of stigma to a structural analysis of how stigma is socially, symbolically, and politically produced on a spatialised level. This idea and the focus it has on a ‘blemish of place’ has been mobilised frequently in urban studies, in particular by those looking at neighbourhood stigmatisation. Through this lens, we can understand how a single estate or area can be stigmatised.
