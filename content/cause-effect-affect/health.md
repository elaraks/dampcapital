The house I live in has a damp problem. It is very minor now; a year ago it was not. White feathery mushroomed under my mattress, black spots climbed the walls. My childhood asthma resurged for the first time in a decade, I endured infection after infection. My joints hurt at night, I’ve developed allergies where before I had done.

Antibiotics, antivirals, steroids, painkillers, bronchodilators, antihistamines, immunomodulators. I have inhaled metered aerosol, swallowed pills with food and on empty stomachs, rubbed creams into my skin like ritual. My friends remark that I am often ill: before this date, my last  prescription had been in 2014. 

So when I speak to someone, and they tell me of their anaphylaxis, of their lying awake at night wondering and worrying, of their trouble walking up the stairs: I always need to catch my breath.
