Damp's cohabitants often experience damage to their belongings â€“ a phenomenon many describe as very distressing.

Mould does not just grow on walls. It grows on numerous surfaces, from clothes and soft furnishings, to electronics and CDs. Cellulose-based materials, like paper, wood, and cardboard, are particularly susceptible, meaning books and photos are often damaged greatly by damp and mould. The cost of replacing essential items can be a large [financial burden](cause-effect-affect/finances) for those enduring dampness. 

In addition to permanent damage, exposure to dampness can temporarily alter the fabric of items. This can be visual, for instance in mould or damp spots that can then be removed through washing or drying, or olfactory, through the clinging of unpleasant [smells](evidence/smell). For those that find this has happened to their clothes, this can generate a great deal of [shame](cause-effect-affect/Shame) when wearing these items outside of the house.
