Founded in 1862, Peabody is one of London's oldest and largest housing associations with around 55,000 properties across London and the South East. Like many housing associations, it is also an [urban regeneration](cause-effect-affect/regeneration) agency and property developer.

About to subsume [Catalyst](providers/catalyst), this is not the first time Peabody has been part of a high profile merger. In 2017, Family Mosaic – a housing association with over 25,000 – homes merged with Peabody. Family Mosaic had previously been the subject to many controversies – for complaints such as including heating being cut-off for five months of the year, a ceiling collapsing, poor administration at one of its care homes, damp housing, and infestations. One [interviewee I spoke to highlighted the problems with such mergers](testimony/interview10) with relation specifically to housing conditions.
