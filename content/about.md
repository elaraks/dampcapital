This is an archive of material, collected and produced as part of the research project *Damp capital: Housing conditions as accumulative disposession*. This research undertaken in the context of an MA programme at the Centre for Research Architecture, in Goldsmiths, University of London.  

Most broadly, this research explores the condition of dampness in Londonâ€™s social housing, in order to understand how housing conditions function as a means of [[accumulative dispossession]], by exploring the relationship between neoliberal housing policy, and housing disrepair.
