- *Postcode*: UB7  
- *Tenancy*: Social housing, housing association  
- *Provider*: Harrow Church Housing Association 
- *Duration of problem*: Since I moved in to the property, in 2011.  
- *Problem type*: Damp and mould (both ongoing)  
- *Have you contacted anyone for help with these problems? What was their response?*: Yes - my house is part of a housing association and we regularly contact them regarding this. They continually advise us to keep our windows open and donâ€™t dry clothes indoors, because this causes mold.
- *Is there anything else you would like to add?*: I have [asthma](cause-effect-affect/Asthma) and the damp and mold severely affects my condition. I wake up every morning with a sore throat, tight chest and coughing due to the damp and mold. Myself and my family feel completely ignored by our housing association and as though we are just a burden instead of a family who needs help.
