- *Postcode*: NW6 5PP
- *Tenancy*: Social housing, council housing  
- *Provider*: Brent council
- *Duration of problem*: 3 years  
- *Problem type*: Damp and mould (both ongoing)  
- *Have you contacted anyone for help with these problems? What was their response?*: Reported to the council, they sent a surveyor and meant to be getting fixed quite soon. It’s taken numerous emails since October for them to respond and send repairs.
- *Is there anything else you would like to add?*: Very disheartening. My block is meant to be demolished soon so maybe that’s why the council cannot be arsed to fix the damp/mould.
