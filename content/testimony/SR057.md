- *Tenancy*: Social housing, council housing  
- *Provider*: [Southwark Council](providers/southwark)
- *Duration of problem*: 15 years  
- *Problem type*: Damp and mould (both ongoing)  
- *Have you contacted anyone for help with these problems? What was their response?*: Southwark Council - initially ignored, the whole bathroom was covered in black mould and the window rotting out of the frame. Mould in the bedroom window. Had to contact local councillors and threaten legal action as they initially said it was from condensation.  They performed "studies" and found nothing wrong but I managed to prove them wrong.       
- *Is there anything else you would like to add?*: Health wise has made my lungs weaks, [suspectable to colds](cause-effect-affect/infection). [Embarrassing](cause-effect-affect/Shame) as refused to have visitors in my home due to [smell](evidence/smell) and how it looks. My son now has bad [asthma](cause-effect-affect/Asthma) and is worse when he's at home compared to visiting other family members.
