---

- *Postcode*: SW9 7PX  
- *Tenancy*: Social housing, council housing  
- *Provider*: [Lambeth Council](providers/Lambeth)
- *Duration of problem*: More than 3 years  
- *Problem type*: Damp and mould (both ongoing)  
- *Have you contacted anyone for help with these problems? What was their response?*: Asked my landlord to do the repairs but to no avail. Have gotten my MP involved too to help speed up the process 
- *Is there anything else you would like to add?*: The damp and mould are at my mother's home who is a social housing tenant. I don't live with her anymore but have been doing the rallying for the repairs for her.  
    
  It's horrible to look at and [embarrassing](cause-effect-affect/Shame) for guests to see. It's disgusting to see my local authority invest in gentrification and prioritise that rather than its social housing tenants.
