- *Postcode*: E10 7AF  
- *Tenancy*: Private rented  
- *Provider*: [PRS](providers/PRS) 
- *Duration of problem*: They lasted for 5 months.  
- *Problem type*: Damp and mould (both ongoing)  
- *Have you contacted anyone for help with these problems? What was their response?*: We contacted our letting agent several times, they informed us that it was our landlords responsibility. We spoke to our landlord multiple times via email and WhatsApp. Despite repeatedly acknowledging the severe damp & mould issue, he dragged his feet in getting it sorted and just kept getting the damp/mould reassessed rather than fixing it. We contacted the council on several occasions via phone and email, finally they sent our landlord an email telling him he needed to fix the issue. We also sought advice from shelter. Ultimately our issue was fixed as a friend of a friend who worked as a lawyer agreed to work pro bono with us. The repairs, which we waited 5 months for, took only 4 days to complete. I've attached a photo of our bedroom wall below.   
- *Is there anything else you would like to add?*: I suffered from terrible [depression](cause-effect-affect/mental-health) as for the entirety of this period of extreme damp/mould. We had to sleep in the kitchen/living room as it got so bad. This was during the first lockdown as well so we were essentially trapped in a single room for months on end. I have also now been rediagnosed with [Asthma](cause-effect-affect/Asthma) and [[cause-effect-affect/Atopy#eczema|Eczema], as a direct result of repeated mould & damp exposure. I suffered quite badly with anxiety in the months following this, and even still wake up in the night sometimes thinking my bedsheets are damp. The damage this damp and mould caused will stay with me forever I think.
