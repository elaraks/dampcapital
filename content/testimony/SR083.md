- *Postcode*: E3 5AS and E11 4AA  
- *Tenancy*: Private rented  
- *Provider*: [PRS](providers/PRS)
- *Duration of problem*: Two separate houses.
First one - throughout the tenancy (months before it was addressed) - leaks from roof into first floor causing leak+damp as well as leak from bathroom into kitchen causing damp
Second one  - throughout the tenancy in the kitchen; days for a leak from bathroom into kitchen  
- *Problem type*: Damp and mould (both historic)  
- *Have you contacted anyone for help with these problems? What was their response?*: Estate agents were unresponsive both times. For the first house, didnâ€™t send anyone around for days/weeks, when they did, person had to be called back twice because issue was recurring. For the second house, had to call multiple times, and person they sent had to come around three/four times because the leak was fixed. 
- *Is there anything else you would like to add?*: Being charged London levels of rent and not even getting acknowledgment from estate agents about the issues is very frustrating and frankly unacceptable. Repair teams were consistently very poor and estate agents want to spend as little money as possible on repairs. 
Bad for our [health](cause-effect-affect/health) and very disruptive. Sometimes means being unable to work from home or go to work because you have to deal with these issues.
