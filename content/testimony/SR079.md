- *Postcode*: NW6 1HX  
- *Tenancy*: Private rented  
- *Provider*: [PRS](providers/PRS) 
- *Duration of problem*: 5 years 
- *Problem type*: Damp and mould (past)  
- *Have you contacted anyone for help with these problems? What was their response?*: Landlord- said to open windows more  
- *Is there anything else you would like to add?*: Damaged lots of property kept in the flat. Despite regularly scrubbing walls, using a dehumidifier, etc- certain things esp. leather and paper always affected. Probably affected health but can't be certain. Lately (years after I left the place) having [trouble breathing](cause-effect-affect/Asthma), prob. Long covid, could never prove a link but have to wonder. Have a close friend with asthma who refused to enter my then home even once, on health grounds. Demoralizing and [humiliating](cause-effect-affect/Shame).
