- *Postcode*: E1 1ER  
- *Tenancy*: Private rented  
- *Provider*: [PRS](providers/PRS)
- *Duration of problem*: We have damp and mould in our flat every winter from about October through to March, and it clears up in the summer
- *Problem type*: Damp and mould (ongoing)  
- *Have you contacted anyone for help with these problems? What was their response?*: We've asked the landlord what to do, and they have sent someone round to take a look. We have electric heaters which give out heat incredibly poorly and the flat is very cold in the winter months, which exacerbates the damp. The landlord's suggested solution was to open the windows (which is far too cold to be realistic in an already cold flat in winter) and keep the heating on - which we cannot afford to do. I wanted to ask for a dehumidifier but I knew they'd say no, based on previous interactions with the landlord, so didn't bother.
- *Is there anything else you would like to add?*: It makes me and my partner frustrated - we have to clean mould off of the soil of our plants weekly in winter, and our clothes are often damp when left in the wardrobes and our drawers. Our flat is really lovely to live in in summer, but we're moving in September as neither of us wants to do another winter here.
