title: "Unravelling the damp capital"
---

In 2021, an ongoing [ITV investigation](media/ITV-Surviving-squalor) brought to light a scandal of cases of damp in social housing across the country. Disrepair has since become both a national media talking point, and a focus of housing campaigners. This heightened level of public attention and discourse surrounding the topic has functioned for me as a moment of access, from which the longer history and processes surrounding the UKâ€™s social housing can be unpeeled.
