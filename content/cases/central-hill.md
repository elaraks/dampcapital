title: Central Hill Estate

## Summary

Council housing in [Lambeth](providers/Lambeth), earmarked for demolition in [regeneration plans](cause-effect-affect/regeneration);

With 476 homes are earmarked for demolition, Central Hill is the largest of Lambeth’s five estates earmarked for demolition. Lambeth says that it is demolishing the estate because the cost of refurbishing the existing homes is £44,000 per dwelling when its average cost for other estates is only £16,000 and that the Council simply doesn’t have the £18.5m required. Residents and campaigners, however, claim the high cost of refurbishment is being exaggerated by the Council and proponents of the plans.

## Timeline

- 1966-1974: Central Hill estate built, designed by Rosemary Stjernstedt, Roger Westman and the Lambeth Council planning department.
