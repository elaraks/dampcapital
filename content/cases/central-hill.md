476 homes are earmarked for demolition on Lambeth’s Central Hill estate.

Central Hill is the largest of Lambeth’s five estates earmarked for demolition.

It was first earmarked for potential redevelopment in a December 2014 Cabinet decision.

Lambeth says that it is demolishing the estate because the cost of refurbishing the existing homes is £44,000 per dwelling when its average cost for other estates is only £16,000 and that the Council simply doesn’t have the £18.5m required.
