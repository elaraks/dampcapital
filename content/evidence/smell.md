title: "Smell"

While damp and mould are often thought of aesthetically, and traced visually, they impart a smell, a lingering musty or scent, or an overwhelming, eye-watering odour.  

This olfactory factor cannot be understated. It is a often reported key of [shame and embarrassment](cause-effect-affect/Shame) for those enduring dampness. In part, this is because it imparts itself, onto your clothes, your body, your belongings, in a way that means many carry it with them outside of the home. As one [BBC headline read this year](media/BBC-smell): *Council housing: 'You become the mould, the stench and the nastiness.'*
