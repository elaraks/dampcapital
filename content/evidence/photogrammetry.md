As part of [interview 02](testimony/interview2), I used photogrammetry to reconstruct a model of Milena's bedroom â€“ the room she most experienced damp problems within her flat.

This was an initial experiment in how the space of dampness might be reprented in a way that could encompass a more affective and totalising perspective, or how it might be used to better illustrate or represent experiences of living in damp condtitions. While ultimately I found the model to be somewhat unsucessful in this respect, and did not continue with this methodological approach, this work did help me refine my thinking around visual representation within the field.
