Where possible, I have been inputting both [survey responses](/Survey) and [news coverage](media/news-tracker) into a database map on QGIS. For survey responses this was done when full postcodes were supplied, and for news coverage where a exact location was either named in the article, or possible to work out by using in-text information and images to geolocate cases.   

ONS data, for example on change in house prices, was then overlayed to help compare and contextualise high cluster areas.
