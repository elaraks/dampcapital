In order to better understand damp housing from a technical perspective, I contacted several professional damp surveyors asking to interview them or shadow one of their surveys. 

Simon Hitchens, from [Damp Surveys Ltd](https://dampsurveys.com/) was particularly helpful, and I shadowed one of a survey he was undertaking on 12th April in Lewisham. The property had recently been inhered by the owner, who wanted to know what work was required on it.

## Outcome survey

Once complete, Simon sent me an anonimised copy of the survey I had shadowed, and an overview of outcomes the last 30 surveys he had undertaken.
