title: "Surveyors"

Surveyors are one of the primary professions associated with dampness. In many settings, they become the arbitor of evidence, the drawer of the line for this threshold condition.

However, within my [research](evidence/dampsurvey) I have encountered problematisations with the authority of surveyors in the realm of dampness. For example, the sole qualification recognised by bodies like the RICS takes less than a week to complete, and involves no hands-on experience, meaning causes are commonly misdiagnosed.

The position of the surveyor has been [mobilised notably by Eyal Weizman](evidence/forensis). This work repositions the role of architecture as a sensor, responding to influences in its environment which can then, in turn, be read and interpreted.
