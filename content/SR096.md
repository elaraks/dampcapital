---

- *Postcode*: SE25 4TT 
- *Tenancy*: Social housing, council housing  
- *Provider*: [[Croydon Council]] 
- *Duration of problem*: The whole 17years I resided at Regina Road.
My family and I was moved earlier this year.  
- *Problem type*: Damp and mould (both in the past)
- *Have you contacted anyone for help with these problems? What was their response?*: Yes numerous times.
Before the problems reached unimaginable levels and received media attention their response was to blame the tenants for poor ventilation etc often leaving us for months upon end for repairs and then carrying out the bear minimum ie mould washes or bodge jobs to temporarily remedy the problems. 
- *Is there anything else you would like to add?*: This caused my family to feel [[Shame & embarrassment|ashamed]] as we would often smell 9f damp. My teenage son never brought any friends home, we would not have people over or entertain due to the conditions we lived in. We suffered with [[Mental health|depression]].
Was bullied by neighbours due to leaks that were 9ut of our control.
My daughter had a [[Asthma|cough]] which became apparent when she ran and slept at night which I can now only believe was due to the conditions we was subjected to living in.
