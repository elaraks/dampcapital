title: "Damp vs mould"
---

Of note is the fact that over 10% of my [survey](Survey) participants reported having mould at present, and having a past problem of damp that they were no longer experiencing. A further 2% reported a past problem of mould, combined with reporting they had never had a problem with damp. This is really interesting because it's not possible to have mould without moisture â€“

By contrast, 4% of survey participants had a present damp problem and a past mould problem, and 5% reporting a present damp problem having never had a mould problem.

The two most common typologies of household damp are [condensation](cause-effect-affect/condensation) and [penetrating damp](cause-effect-affect/penetrating-damp)
