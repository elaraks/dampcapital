Photographs taken of house mould grown in petri dishes on nutrient agar, cultivated using swab and air samples. Through accelerating the growth of household mould, I wanted to question at which point damp becomes visible or legible, while seeking to also understand how attritional violence might be ‘cultivated’ through deliberate efforts. I did not progress this methodology, but highlight it due to its informative role in my thinking on the temporalities at play in this threshold condition.

Agar plates are a type of culture or growth [medium](media/media) – solid, liquid, or semi-solid substances designed to support the growth of a population of microorganisms or cells.
