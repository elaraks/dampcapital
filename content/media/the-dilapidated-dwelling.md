*The Dilapidated Dwelling* is a 2000 film by Patrick Keiller. Narrated by a British researcher (voiced by Tilda Swinton) who has just returned from the Arctic after 20 years, and has been charged with the task of researching 'the pridicament of the house.' She contemplates why the country's dwellings, despite its wealth, are so [dilapidated](cause-effect-affect/dilapidation) and expensive.
