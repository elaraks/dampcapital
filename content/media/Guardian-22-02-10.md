Article in the Guardian, covering [resistance](resistance/resistance) to damp conditions being carried out by tenants of Evelyn Court, an estate in [Hackney](providers/hackney) managed by housing association Industrial Dwelling Society. Tenants were organised by [London Renters Union](resistance/renters-unions). Use of the word 'revolt' in the headline and text is notable for its double meaning, playing on the nature of their conditions as revolting.
