Given the central role that ITV's [*Surviving Squalor*](media/ITV-Surviving-squalor) has played in the foregrounding of damp housing, media more broadly is an important topic. The media transmission of the idea that social housing is materially defective as a category is an essential part of the dismantling of social housing. Throughout this year, I have been [tracking news coverage](media/news-tracker) of the subject in order to examine the relationship between these topics.

While scholarship has often foregrounded the production and proliferation of an idea of criminality in relation to social housing as a means to justify and enable its denigration, the role that the idea of physical dilapidation plays alongside this should not be overlooked. We might look to Channel 4’s infamous [ident](media/c4-ident) of the Aylesbury estate, which ran for a decade between 2004-2014. In this short clip, repeatedly broadcast between programming, we see a manufactured image of the estate as run down, replete with graffiti ‘absent in real life,’ staged with ‘rubbish across the whole of the area.’ Although coverage of damp conditions is not staged in this same way, it still engages in this same ecosystem of discourses. 

Further to this, the growing mass of visual and textual material on poor conditions can be said to impact increasing levels of [stigmatisation](cause-effect-affect/stigma) for tenants. Of note are the role that comment sections play within this, visible in many of the coverage included in this archive.
