---

- *Postcode*: SE19 1EU 
- *Tenancy*: Leaseholder 
- *Provider*: [[Lambeth]] Council freeholder
- *Duration of problem*: Since I moved in 5 years ago. The mould/damp comes back every winter even if you treat it. Council surveyor came and said itâ€™s the design of the building.
- *Problem type*: Damp (in the past) and mould (ongoing)
- *Have you contacted anyone for help with these problems? What was their response?*: As above with surveyor. 
- *Is there anything else you would like to add?*: The mould is [[health|unhealthy]] and [[shame|embarrassing]] when others come round, I have to apologise. I worry every time I see it. Also the [[finances|expense]] of getting it treated every year is a big worry.
