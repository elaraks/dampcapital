- *Postcode*: SE16    
- *Tenancy*: Social housing, council housing  
- *Provider*: [[Southwark]] council
- *Duration of problem*: Since I was 7/8 and I am now 33. They have fixed it but it always comes back
- *Problem type*: Damp and mould (both ongoing)  
- *Have you contacted anyone for help with these problems? What was their response?*: Yes the Council, they came and fixed it after chasing them up but it does not solve the underlying issues   
- *Is there anything else you would like to add?*: It makes you feel [[shame|embarrassed]] as we take very good care of our home and tired having to incessantly chase the council to fix it
