Those who endure damp conditions face heightened finacial costs, undertaken in order to mitigate the problem and its effects. 

These are wide-ranging, and can be direct or indirect, long-term, or occasional. A direct and occasional financial impact might be the need to buy specialist paint to treat a damp or mouldy wall, or replacing damaged belongings. A direct long-term financial impact might be increased energy costs due to the need to run a dehumidifier, or heat the property to a higher degree (for instance, to mitigate warmth lost through leaving windows open in winter). A indirect financial impact might be wages lost due to sickness, either from a long term or an accute health problem likely exaccerbated or caused by someone's living conditions.
